## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-10

**IPv6 write parity - closes `ROADMAP.md`'s Tier 3 "IPv6 parity" item
entirely.** Six guarded write tools, each mirroring an existing IPv4 write
tool field-for-field on the equivalent `/ipv6/*` path - completing what
v1.9's IPv6 reads deliberately left open.

- `enable_ipv6_firewall_rule` / `disable_ipv6_firewall_rule`
  (`/ipv6/firewall/filter`): mirror `enable_firewall_rule`/
  `disable_firewall_rule` - toggle an EXISTING rule's `disabled` field by
  `comment` (optionally narrowed by `chain`), NEVER create one. No IPv6
  equivalent of `move_firewall_rule` (reorder) in this release.
- `add_ipv6_route` / `remove_ipv6_route` (`/ipv6/route`): mirror
  `add_route`/`remove_route`, including `remove_ipv6_route`'s most
  important safety property - **refuses outright to remove a dynamic route**
  (`dynamic=true`, checked via `formatting.coerce_ros_bool`, never a
  `== "true"` string comparison, same 1.5.0 lesson `remove_route` learned).
  Both carry the `::/0` default-route `warning` their IPv4 counterparts
  already carry for `0.0.0.0/0`.
- `add_to_ipv6_address_list` / `remove_from_ipv6_address_list`
  (`/ipv6/firewall/address-list`): mirror `add_to_address_list`/
  `remove_from_address_list` - list-only, never touches a firewall rule;
  refuses a duplicate `list_name`+`address` pair.

**IPv6-only address validation**: `dst_address`/`gateway`/`address` on all
six tools are validated with new IPv6-only functions
(`validate_ipv6_dst_address`, `validate_ipv6_route_gateway`,
`validate_ipv6_target`) that explicitly REJECT an IPv4 match, unlike their
IPv4-or-IPv6 counterparts (`validate_dst_address`/`validate_route_gateway`/
`validate_target`) - an IPv4 address/subnet is syntactically indistinguishable
from garbage to any `/ipv6/*` menu, so it's rejected client-side with a
clear error before the device is ever touched, rather than forwarded and
surfaced as whatever RouterOS's own rejection looks like.

**"ipv6 package disabled" trap - deliberately different behavior from
v1.9's reads**: the v1.9 read tools catch `DeviceCommandError` from a
disabled `ipv6` package and return `[]`. These six WRITE tools do **not** -
a write has no safe "nothing happened" empty-list shape to fall back to,
so `DeviceCommandError` is left to propagate as a normal (audited) write
error instead of being silently swallowed into a result that would look
identical to "there was nothing to toggle/remove".

**Implementation note**: rather than duplicating IPv4 logic, `add_route`/
`remove_route`/`add_to_address_list`/`remove_from_address_list` in
`guard.py` were refactored into shared private helpers
(`_add_route`/`_remove_route`/`_add_to_address_list`/
`_remove_from_address_list`) parameterized by `operation_name` (which
ALLOWLIST entry, hence which `/ip/*` vs `/ipv6/*` path) and validator
functions; the public `add_route`/`remove_route`/`add_to_address_list`/
`remove_from_address_list` and their new `..._ipv6_...` counterparts are
now thin wrappers around the shared helper, matching the pattern
`enable_route`/`disable_route` and `enable_firewall_rule`/
`disable_firewall_rule` already established. `_set_firewall_rule_disabled`
(already generalized since v1.4's NAT/mangle toggle) needed no changes at
all - `enable_ipv6_firewall_rule`/`disable_ipv6_firewall_rule` are thin
wrappers around it, exactly like `enable_nat_rule`/`enable_mangle_rule`.
The full IPv4 test suite (unchanged assertions) passes against the
refactored functions, proving no IPv4 regression. 108 tools total, 100%
line coverage maintained.

**Hardware-verified**: on real ROS7 (`.237`, `ipv6` ON) `remove_ipv6_route`
refused a live dynamic route (`::1/128`, `dynamic=True`) via the shared
`coerce_ros_bool` guard, and `add_ipv6_route`/`remove_ipv6_route` round-tripped
a static `2001:db8::/32` route reversibly; on real ROS6 (`.254`, `ipv6` OFF) a
v6 write correctly propagated `DeviceCommandError` (not a silent `[]`),
confirming the deliberate reads-vs-writes skip-if-missing split. IPv6 NAT (NPT)
and v6 firewall-rule reorder are explicitly out of scope - see `ROADMAP.md`.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-10

**IPv6 read parity - opens up `ROADMAP.md`'s Tier 3.** Five read-only
tools, each mirroring an existing IPv4 read tool field-for-field on the
equivalent `/ipv6/*` path. IPv6 writes (firewall rule toggle, route add/
remove) are explicitly deferred to a later release - see `ROADMAP.md`'s
Tier 3 entry.

- `ipv6_addresses` (`/ipv6/address`): mirrors `ip_addresses`. address,
  interface, advertise, disabled, dynamic.
- `ipv6_routes` (`/ipv6/route`): mirrors `ip_routes`, including its
  optional `limit` (capped at `MAX_ROUTE_LIMIT`, same 500 cap). dst-address,
  gateway, distance, active, dynamic, disabled.
- `ipv6_firewall_filter` (`/ipv6/firewall/filter`): mirrors
  `firewall_filter`. Read-only - does not add/modify/remove rules.
- `ipv6_neighbors` (`/ipv6/neighbor`): mirrors `arp_table` - IPv6's
  neighbor-discovery equivalent of the IPv4 ARP table. address,
  mac-address, interface, status, dynamic.
- `ipv6_firewall_address_lists` (`/ipv6/firewall/address-list`): mirrors
  `address_lists`. list, address, dynamic, disabled.

**Trap this release specifically guards against**: the whole `/ipv6/*`
menu subtree raises if the `ipv6` package is disabled on the device (a
common, fully supported state) - all five tools above catch
`DeviceCommandError` and return `[]` instead of propagating, the same
skip-if-missing pattern already established by `wireguard_peers`,
`ppp_active`, `bgp_sessions`, `ospf_neighbors`, and others. Like the IPv4
reads they mirror, these tools return RouterOS's rows as-is (raw passthrough,
no server-side boolean coercion); the fixtures/tests use real Python `bool`
values, matching what librouteros returns. 102 tools total, 100% line
coverage maintained.

Hardware-verified both sides: skip-if-missing confirmed on real ROS6 (`.254`,
`ipv6` package OFF - all five paths raise `DeviceCommandError`, tools return
`[]`); happy path confirmed on real ROS7 (`.237`, `ipv6` ON - real addresses,
routes, and 23 neighbor entries; field shapes match).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-10

**NTP client + clock - closes out `ROADMAP.md`'s Tier 2.** Two read tools
and one guarded write, the last item Tier 2 named after v1.6/v1.7 shipped
everything else in it (certificates/users/RADIUS, then SFP monitor/DHCP
server config/bridge VLAN filtering).

- `ntp_client` (`/system/ntp/client`): NTP client configuration/status. Every
  field RouterOS's own reply carries is returned as-is (`.get`-based, nothing
  invented) - only `enabled` is normalized via `formatting.coerce_ros_bool`.
  ROS7's `servers` field (a comma-joined list of configured servers) is left
  exactly as RouterOS sends it, never split into a Python list - the same
  "no invented shape" convention v1.7's `bridge_vlans` already established
  for `tagged`/`untagged`. Returns an empty dict (never an error) for a
  device with no NTP client menu at all.
- `system_clock` (`/system/clock`): `time`, `date`, `time-zone-name`,
  `time-zone-autodetect` and `dst-active` (both coerced to `bool | None`),
  `gmt-offset`. Clock drift breaks certificate validation, log timestamps,
  and scheduler timing - check this alongside `ntp_client`'s
  `status`/`synced-server` when diagnosing any of those.
- `set_ntp_servers` (WRITE, guarded): sets the NTP server(s) a device syncs
  against. **ROS6/ROS7 field-shape split, same generation as
  `/system/ntp/client` on both - unlike `set_wifi_ssid`'s genuinely
  different menus, this is one RouterOS path with two different field
  shapes**, detected by reading the row once and checking which field is
  present - `servers` (ROS7) or `primary-ntp` (ROS6) - the same "read
  first, then decide" detection `set_wifi_ssid` already established for its
  own ROS6/ROS7 split. ROS7 writes the full comma-joined `servers` list.
  ROS6 has no `servers` list at all - only two fixed slots: `servers[0]`
  maps to `primary-ntp`, `servers[1]` (if given) to `secondary-ntp`; extra
  entries beyond two are dropped, with `warning` naming exactly which ones.
  Older ROS6 firmware only accepts a literal IP in either slot - a hostname
  destined for one of those two slots is instead folded into
  `server-dns-names` (RouterOS's own DNS-name field for this menu) IF the
  device's row shows that field exists, otherwise it is not applied at all
  (never a value RouterOS would likely reject) and `warning` says so; if
  nothing at all ends up applicable, this raises `ValidationError` instead
  of silently performing a no-op write. Never enables/disables the NTP
  client itself - only the server list changes; `warning` also fires when
  the client is currently disabled, since new servers won't be used until
  it's enabled separately (out of scope here). Every server is validated as
  an IPv4/IPv6 address OR hostname (`validate_ping_address`, reused as-is)
  before anything is read from the device - fail fast on a caller mistake.
  New `validation.is_literal_ip_address` - a non-raising boolean cousin of
  `validate_ip_address`, reusing the same `_IPV4`/`_IPV6` matchers - backs
  the IP-vs-hostname branch on the ROS6 side.

**Hardware-verified, both generations**: reads confirmed on real ROS7
(`.237`, `servers` shape) and real ROS6 6.49 (`.254`, `primary-ntp` shape -
so the ROS6 branch is a live path in the field, not a legacy hypothetical).
`set_ntp_servers` exercised end-to-end and reversibly on both: the ROS7
`servers` write on `.237` (set then cleared back), and the ROS6 branch on
`.254` (set `primary-ntp` to a different valid NTP IP, confirmed it applied,
restored the original exactly). `dst-active`/`enabled` came back as real
Python `bool` (coerce_ros_bool path). **Still unverified**: only IP servers
were exercised on the ROS6 device - the hostname-to-`server-dns-names` fold
(and whether older ROS6 firmware rejects a hostname in `primary-ntp`) is
still fake-only, since no hostname was written to a real ROS6 box.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-10

**Network-config visibility (Tier 2, all read-only)**: five new read tools
closing out the rest of `ROADMAP.md`'s Tier 2 - SFP/optical link monitoring,
DHCP server config, and bridge VLAN filtering (the honest completion of the
VLAN story for a managed switch, as opposed to v1.2's standalone
`/interface/vlan`).

- `interface_monitor` (`/interface/ethernet/monitor once=yes`): link
  status/rate/duplex for any ethernet port, plus SFP/DDM optics fields
  (`sfp-temperature`, `sfp-supply-voltage`, `sfp-tx-power`, `sfp-rx-power`,
  `sfp-tx-bias-current`, `sfp-vendor-name`, `sfp-vendor-part-number`,
  `sfp-wavelength`, `sfp-module-present`) ONLY when the device's reply
  actually carries them - a plain copper port has none of the sfp-* keys at
  all, never invented. `full-duplex`/`sfp-module-present` are coerced to
  `bool | None` (`formatting.coerce_ros_bool`); `auto-negotiation` is left
  as RouterOS's own raw value (not a strict boolean).
  - **New `MikrotikClient.ethernet_monitor`**: same "monitor once" shape
    as `monitor_traffic`/`poe_monitor`/`lte_monitor` - materializes the
    reply with `list(...)` before subscripting (librouteros returns a
    GENERATOR here too, same v0.7.1 lesson as the other three). Selects the
    port via `numbers=` (NOT `interface=`, which real ROS6/ROS7 reject with
    "unknown parameter" - unlike the sibling monitors); the fake now models
    that quirk so a regression is caught by the suite.
  - **Hardware**: link status/rate/`full-duplex` verified on real ROS6
    (`.254`, 1Gbps) and ROS7 (`.237`, 100Mbps). The SFP/DDM field VALUES are
    still not verified - the reference boards have no SFP cage. See `ROADMAP.md`.
- `dhcp_servers` (`/ip/dhcp-server`): `name`, `interface`, `address-pool`,
  `lease-time`, `authoritative`, `comment`, with `disabled` coerced to
  `bool | None`. As opposed to the already-shipped `dhcp_leases` (what a
  server has handed out), this is the server's own config.
- `dhcp_networks` (`/ip/dhcp-server/network`): `address`, `gateway`,
  `dns-server`, `netmask`, `domain`, `comment` - the per-subnet options a
  DHCP server hands out on lease.
- `bridge_ports` (`/interface/bridge/port`): `bridge`, `interface`, `pvid`,
  `disabled`, `edge`, `horizon`, `learn`, `comment`. Only `disabled` is
  coerced to `bool | None` - `edge`/`learn` are RouterOS enums
  (`auto`/`yes`/`no`/`yes-discover`/`no-discover`), not strict booleans, so
  they're left as RouterOS's own raw value.
- `bridge_vlans` (`/interface/bridge/vlan`): `bridge`, `vlan-ids`, `tagged`,
  `untagged`, `comment`, plus `current-tagged`/`current-untagged` when
  present. Together with `bridge_ports`, this is the missing half of VLAN
  visibility for a managed switch (CRS/hEX-style hardware, bridge VLAN
  filtering) - the v1.2 VLAN tools only ever covered standalone
  `/interface/vlan` router-on-a-stick interfaces.

All five follow the project's Lição B convention throughout: every RouterOS
boolean field this round touches goes through `formatting.coerce_ros_bool`
(never a `== "true"` string-equality comparison), since librouteros hands a
RouterOS boolean back as a Python `bool` or omits the field entirely - never
the string `"true"`/`"false"`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-10

**AAA/PKI visibility (Tier 2, all read-only)**: four new read tools closing
out most of `ROADMAP.md`'s Tier 2 - certificate expiry, users/AAA, and
RADIUS - the visibility gap this project's own `security_audit` already
gestured at (`_check_users` has read `/user` internally since v0.12) but
never surfaced as first-class tools.

- `certificates` (`/certificate`): name, common-name, subject/issuer
  fields, `invalid-before`/`invalid-after` (raw), key-size/key-type,
  fingerprint, and RouterOS's own `expired`/`trusted` flags, returned as-is
  (see `formatting.coerce_ros_bool` for a caller that needs to branch on
  them). Adds a computed `daysUntilExpiry` (negative once past due) from
  `invalid-after` whenever it parses.
  - **New helper `formatting.parse_ros_datetime`**: RouterOS's own date
    rendering varies by version/locale - two shapes are confirmed and
    handled (`"2027-01-15 12:00:00"` and `"jan/15/2027 12:00:00"`, the
    latter matched against a fixed English month-abbreviation table rather
    than `strptime`'s locale-dependent `%b`, since RouterOS always renders
    it in English regardless of the server process's own locale). DEFENSIVE
    BY DESIGN: never raises - an unparseable/unrecognized date returns
    `None`, so `daysUntilExpiry` is simply omitted (the raw `invalid-after`
    field is left untouched) rather than the tool breaking or guessing.
    `formatting.days_until` wraps it into the `(parsed - now).days`
    computation both `certificates` and the new security-audit check below
    share, so they can never compute expiry two different ways.
  - **SECURITY**: `/certificate`'s own API reply never carries a private
    key (RouterOS only returns certificate metadata over the API) - a
    `private-key` field is nonetheless stripped defensively before
    returning, same `strip_sensitive_fields` mechanism `ppp_secrets`/
    `wireguard_interfaces` already use, in case a future RouterOS version
    or firmware quirk ever adds one.
  - **New `security_audit` check (#8)**: flags an expired certificate
    (`high`) or one expiring within 30 days (`medium`) - an expired
    certificate on a management/VPN/hotspot service is a silent outage.
    Trusts RouterOS's own `expired` flag OR a negative `daysUntilExpiry`,
    either sufficient on its own, so a device that only reliably exposes
    one of the two still gets a correct answer; a certificate with neither
    available contributes no finding rather than guessing.
- `users` (`/user`): name, group, address (allowed-source restriction, if
  any), last-logged-in, disabled, comment. `/user`'s own API reply never
  carries a password at all, so there's nothing to strip. READ only -
  creating/editing a `/user` login stays out of scope (see `ROADMAP.md`'s
  "Explicitly NOT on the roadmap" - a router login is a device/API
  credential, a different risk class from a service credential like a PPP
  secret or hotspot user).
- `user_active` (`/user/active`): currently logged-in RouterOS management
  sessions (name, address, via, when) - who's on the box's own admin
  interface right now, as opposed to `users`' configured accounts.
- `radius` (`/radius`): service, address, timeout, accounting-port,
  authentication-port, etc.
  - **SECURITY**: RouterOS's own `/radius` reply carries the plaintext
    shared `secret` - ALWAYS stripped before returning
    (`strip_sensitive_fields`), the exact mechanism `ppp_secrets` uses for
    `/ppp/secret`'s `password`. A RADIUS shared secret never leaves this
    process via this tool. See `test_radius_never_exposes_secret`.

All four are read-only, boolean fields are read via `coerce_ros_bool`
(never a bare `== "true"`/`== "yes"` string comparison - see v1.5's
security-fix entry below for why that class of bug matters), and every new
test fixture (`tests/conftest.py`, `tests/fakes.py`) returns Python `bool`
for boolean fields, matching real hardware.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-10

**Static route add / remove** (`/ip/route`), closing `ROADMAP.md`'s Tier 1
and extending the v0.9 route family (`set_route_distance`,
`enable_route`/`disable_route`) with the two writes that were still missing:
creating and deleting a route outright, rather than only adjusting one
already on the device.

- `add_route` (guarded write): creates a static route from `dst_address` +
  `gateway` (both required), with optional `distance` and `comment`.
  **Never refuses a duplicate `dst_address`** - unlike `add_vlan`/
  `add_static_dns`, multiple routes sharing a `dst-address` is the normal
  failover shape (see `_resolve_route`'s own docstring), so a second
  `0.0.0.0/0` pointing at a different gateway is not an error here. If
  `dst_address` is the default route (`0.0.0.0/0`/`::/0`), the returned
  preview's `warning` field is set to a clear, non-null message - adding or
  overriding the default route redirects all outbound traffic through the
  new gateway - present on both the `confirm=False` preview and the
  `confirm=True` applied result.
- `remove_route` (guarded write): removes a route resolved by `dst_address`,
  narrowed by `gateway` when more than one route shares that `dst_address`
  (reusing `_resolve_route` exactly as `set_route_distance`/`enable_route`/
  `disable_route` already do - `ResourceNotFoundError`/`AmbiguousResourceError`
  apply identically, never guessing which row to remove). Same default-route
  `warning` pattern as `add_route`, for the removal direction.
- **Key safety property**: `remove_route` REFUSES OUTRIGHT to remove a
  dynamic route. If the resolved row's `dynamic` field coerces to `True`
  (see `coerce_ros_bool` below - a connected/DHCP/OSPF/BGP-installed route,
  not one an operator created by hand), it raises `ValidationError` before
  building any preview and never calls the write primitive - a hard
  refusal, not merely a warning, unlike `remove_dhcp_lease`'s softer "warn
  but allow" handling of a static lease. Removing a device's
  connected/dynamic route can sever the network entirely, so this tool only
  ever manages static, admin-created routes; removing a dynamic route (if
  genuinely intended) must be done manually on the device.

**SECURITY FIX - RouterOS boolean fields compared against the wrong type**
(caught in real-hardware testing against ROS6 `.254` and ROS7 `.237`,
*before* this release ever shipped). `librouteros` - the real device
transport this package uses - returns a RouterOS boolean field (`dynamic`,
`disabled`, etc.) as a Python `bool` (`True`/`False`), or omits the field
entirely (`None`) when RouterOS itself omits it; it **never** returns the
strings `"true"`/`"false"`, unlike this package's own test fakes prior to
this fix. Because `True == "true"` is `False` in Python, `remove_route`'s
dynamic-route refusal above - written as `row.get("dynamic") == "true"` -
**never actually matched on real hardware**: a connected/DHCP/OSPF/
BGP-installed route (including the default route) could be removed
outright, with no refusal, potentially severing the network. The test
fakes (`tests/fakes.py`, `tests/conftest.py`) returned the string
`"true"`/`"false"` for these fields, so the existing test suite passed
despite the bug - it only surfaced against real hardware.
  - Added `coerce_ros_bool(value) -> bool | None` (`formatting.py`): the
    correct normalizer for this class of write-guard *logic* (as opposed to
    `ros_bool`, already used for read-tool *presentation*, which was never
    affected - it already checked `isinstance(value, bool)` first). Accepts
    a real `bool`, a case-insensitive `"true"/"yes"/"false"/"no"` string
    (defensively), or `None`/absent/unrecognized (returned as `None`, not
    guessed as `False`, so a caller can tell "definitely false" apart from
    "unknown").
  - `remove_route` now refuses when `coerce_ros_bool(row.get("dynamic")) is
    True` - correctly matching a real device's `True`, `"true"`, `False`,
    or absent `dynamic` field, instead of only the string `"true"`.
  - **Bonus fix found by the same audit**: `remove_dhcp_lease`'s
    static-lease warning had the identical bug (`row.get("dynamic") ==
    "false"`) - lower severity (it only skips a warning, never blocks a
    removal) but the same wrong-type comparison. Now uses
    `coerce_ros_bool(row.get("dynamic")) is not True`, so the warning fires
    for both an explicit `dynamic=False` (ROS7) and an omitted `dynamic`
    field (ROS6's shape for a static lease).
  - The full codebase was audited for every `== "true"`/`== "false"`/
    `== "yes"`/`== "no"` comparison against a RouterOS field; these two
    (`remove_route`, `remove_dhcp_lease`) were the only ones affecting
    control flow. `security.py`/`formatting.py` already routed every other
    boolean-field check through `ros_bool`, which was never affected.
  - Test fakes updated to match: `tests/conftest.py`'s shared fixture and
    `tests/fakes.py`'s WireGuard `add()` defaults now return Python `bool`
    (mirroring `librouteros`'s real shape) instead of the strings
    `"true"`/`"false"` for every field this package interprets as boolean
    (`dynamic`, `disabled`, `running`, `complete`, `local`, `assured`,
    `confirmed`, `seen-reply`) - this is what makes the test suite able to
    catch this class of bug going forward. Added explicit regression tests
    proving `remove_route`/`remove_dhcp_lease` behave correctly for the
    real `bool`/`None` shape (and still refuse a legacy string `"true"`,
    defensively).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-10

**NAT rule toggle + firewall mangle (read + toggle)**, extending v0.11's
`enable_firewall_rule`/`disable_firewall_rule` pattern - resolve an EXISTING,
admin-authored rule by its stable `comment`, flip only its `disabled` field,
never create a rule - to the two other firewall menus this project already
reads (`firewall_nat`) or now adds a read for (`firewall_mangle`). Same
lockout reasoning as filter: a wrong write to NAT (e.g. disabling the
masquerade rule providing a LAN's Internet access) or mangle can be just as
disruptive as a wrong filter write, so rule creation/free-form edit stays out
of scope for both, exactly like filter - see `ROADMAP.md`'s "Explicitly NOT
on the roadmap".

- `firewall_mangle` (read-only): lists `/ip/firewall/mangle` rows - chain
  (`prerouting`/`postrouting`/`forward`/`input`/`output`, or a custom
  jump-target chain), action, comment, disabled, plus whatever other fields
  RouterOS returns for a given rule. Same passthrough formatting as
  `firewall_filter`/`firewall_nat` - fields absent from a given rule (they
  vary a lot by `action`) simply don't appear, rather than the tool
  assuming a fixed shape.
- `enable_nat_rule` / `disable_nat_rule` (guarded writes): toggle an
  EXISTING `/ip/firewall/nat` rule's `disabled` field, resolved by
  `comment` (optionally narrowed by `chain` - `srcnat`/`dstnat` - if more
  than one rule shares that comment). `firewall_nat` itself already existed
  (v0.4) as read-only; this round adds the write side.
- `enable_mangle_rule` / `disable_mangle_rule` (guarded writes): same
  toggle-by-comment pattern applied to `/ip/firewall/mangle`, optionally
  narrowed by `chain`.
- All four resolve **never falling back to creating a rule**: an unmatched
  `comment` raises `ResourceNotFoundError`; a `comment` that still matches
  more than one row after narrowing by `chain` raises
  `AmbiguousResourceError` - never guesses which one to toggle. Identical
  guarantee to `enable_firewall_rule`/`disable_firewall_rule`.
- **Implementation**: `guard.py`'s private `_set_firewall_rule_disabled` -
  the shared implementation behind the filter pair since v0.11 - is
  GENERALIZED (one new `resource_label` keyword argument, defaulting to
  `"Firewall filter rule"` so the filter pair's own behavior is byte-for-byte
  unchanged) rather than copy-pasted three times; `_find_firewall_rule_rows`
  needed no change at all, since it already only operated on an
  already-fetched row list, never a hardcoded path. Filter's own test suite
  passes unmodified, plus a new regression test
  (`test_enable_firewall_rule_unknown_comment_error_names_filter_resource`)
  pins the unchanged default. `validate_firewall_rule_comment`/
  `validate_firewall_chain` (v0.11) are reused as-is - both were already
  path-agnostic; `chain` stays shape-only (not a fixed enum) for NAT/mangle,
  the same reasoning that already applied to filter's custom jump-target
  chains.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-10

**PPP/PPPoE secrets** (`/ppp/secret`), following the existing write-guard
model exactly (read-only by default, every write routed through `guard.py`'s
allowlist, confirm/preview before applying, audit-journaled) and, more
specifically, `add_hotspot_user`'s (v0.14) own precedent for handling a
*service* credential (dial-in network access only, never router admin - a
different, lower risk class than a `/user` login, which remains deliberately
off the roadmap - see `ROADMAP.md`'s non-goal note).

- `ppp_secrets` (read-only): lists configured `/ppp/secret` rows - name,
  service, profile, remote-address, local-address (if set), disabled,
  comment, last-logged-out (if set) - as opposed to the pre-existing
  `ppp_active`, which lists currently-CONNECTED sessions. **Never returns a
  secret's `password`** - stripped via `formatting.strip_sensitive_fields`,
  the same mechanism `wireguard_interfaces` uses for a tunnel interface's
  private-key.
- `add_ppp_secret` (guarded write): creates a secret - `name`/`password` are
  the dial-in credentials, `service` (default `"any"`, one of
  `pppoe`/`pptp`/`l2tp`/`ovpn`/`sstp`/`any`) restricts which PPP service it
  authenticates for, `profile`/`remote_address`/`comment` are optional.
  Refuses to create a duplicate `name`. **PASSWORD ASYMMETRY**: like
  `add_hotspot_user`'s voucher password, `password` DELIBERATELY appears in
  this tool's own result (the caller supplied it and gets it echoed back as
  confirmation) but is never journaled - `audit._SENSITIVE_KEY` already
  matches `"password"`, so no new redaction code was needed.
- `remove_ppp_secret` (guarded write): removes a secret by `name`. Raises
  `AmbiguousResourceError` instead of guessing if more than one row somehow
  shares a `name`. Unlike `add_ppp_secret`, this reads an EXISTING row back
  first - its `password` field is stripped in `guard.py`, before the
  `WritePreview` is ever constructed (the same "redact before constructing
  the preview" rule v0.13's WireGuard round established), so it can never
  leak into the returned preview or the audit journal either.
- Four new validators added to `validation.py`: `validate_ppp_secret_name`,
  `validate_ppp_secret_password`, `validate_ppp_service` (enum-checked
  against the six values above), `validate_ppp_profile` - `remote_address`
  reuses the existing `validate_ip_address`, `comment` reuses
  `validate_comment`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-10

Two new feature areas, both following the existing write-guard model
exactly (read-only by default, every write routed through `guard.py`'s
allowlist, confirm/preview before applying, audit-journaled).

- **VLAN management** (`/interface/vlan`): `list_vlans` (read-only, excludes
  disabled VLANs by default like `interfaces`), `add_vlan` (guarded write -
  `name`, `vlan_id` 1-4094, parent `interface`, optional `mtu`/`comment`;
  refuses a duplicate `name`), and `remove_vlan` (guarded write - by `name`;
  errors if it doesn't exist). Two new validators added (`validate_vlan_id`,
  `validate_mtu`) - `name`/`interface` reuse the existing
  `validate_interface_name`.
- **Firewall filter rule reorder**: `move_firewall_rule` (guarded write -
  `/ip/firewall/filter move`), resolved by the rule's `comment` (optionally
  narrowed by `chain`, the same resolution `enable_firewall_rule`/
  `disable_firewall_rule` use). NEVER creates or edits a rule's fields -
  only its position in the chain's evaluation order changes, to either
  immediately before another rule (`before_comment`) or a given 0-based
  index (`position`). This is the first `guard.ALLOWLIST` entry whose
  `action` is `"move"` - a fourth kind of RouterOS ACTION command alongside
  `start`/`stop`, `flush`/`wol`, and `save` - so `MikrotikClient` gained a
  new `move()` write primitive, and the `test_server_never_calls_write_primitives_directly`
  meta-test's forbidden-pattern regex now also covers `.move(`.

## [Unreleased]

Open-source-readiness pass: no new tool, no behavior change - CI hardening,
contributor onboarding, and closing every remaining test-coverage gap.

- **CI now runs three jobs** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `test` (the full
  `pytest` suite across a Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 matrix, with
  `--cov-fail-under=95`), `lint` (`ruff check` + `ruff format --check`), and
  `typecheck` (`mypy src/mcp_mikrotik`). Previously CI only ran `pytest` on
  3.11/3.12 with no lint/type/coverage gate.
- **`ruff` adopted** for lint + formatting (`[tool.ruff]` in
  `pyproject.toml`): the whole codebase reformatted to a consistent
  120-column style and 13 pre-existing lint findings fixed (all style-only -
  sorted imports, `collections.abc` over deprecated `typing` aliases, a
  `dict()` call rewritten as a literal, a `try`/`except`/`pass` rewritten as
  `contextlib.suppress`, an inlined boolean return - no behavior change).
- **`mypy` adopted** for type-checking (`[tool.mypy]` in `pyproject.toml`):
  `client.py`'s `RouterosConnection` Protocol split into
  `RouterosConnection`/`RouterosPath` so `.path(...)`'s return type
  correctly describes the `.add()`/`.update()`/`.remove()`/callable shape
  callers actually use (previously typed as plain `Iterable[dict[str,
  Any]]`, which mypy correctly flagged as not supporting those); a genuine
  `os.environ` vs `dict[str, str]` type mismatch fixed in
  `config.load_settings` (widened to `Mapping[str, str]`, since
  `os.environ` is an `_Environ[str]`, not a `dict`). `librouteros` ships no
  type stubs, so it's exempted via `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` and covered
  instead by the Protocols above.
- **Test coverage closed to 100%** (from 97%; CI's floor is 95% - see
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s "Test coverage" for why the floor sits below the
  actual number), adding 140 tests across error/security paths that were
  previously untested end-to-end:
  - Direct unit tests for validators that had none at all despite being
    used in guarded write tools (`validate_port`, `validate_wireguard_key`,
    `validate_allowed_address_list`, `validate_hotspot_username`/
    `_password`/`_profile`, `validate_backup_name`/`_password`), plus the
    "too long" branch of `validate_ip_address`/`validate_target`/
    `validate_dst_address`/`validate_route_gateway`.
  - `config.py`'s YAML-shape error paths (non-mapping top level, non-list
    `devices` key, non-mapping device entry, a boolean/`None` `name`/`host`
    field) and `client.py`'s env-var parsing fallbacks
    (`MIKROTIK_READ_RETRIES`/`_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`/`_BREAKER_COOLDOWN`/
    `_TIMEOUT` given an unparseable or out-of-range value).
  - A new `tests/test_formatting.py` (this module had none): `ros_bool`'s
    non-bool/non-recognized-string fallback, `split_address_port`'s
    bracketed-IPv6 edge cases.
  - `guard.py`'s `set_wifi_ssid` configuration-read-failure wrapping (a
    `/interface/wifi/configuration` read failing after the interface's
    `configuration` reference already resolved) and
    `set_client_bandwidth`'s `limit_at` handling on the update (not just
    create) path.
  - `security.py`'s outer `except DeviceCommandError` backstop in
    `run_security_audit` (every real check already catches its own; this
    proves the second, outer layer works too, via a monkeypatched fake
    check).
  - `server.py`: `ip_addresses`/`neighbors`/`logs` (including its `topics`
    filter) had zero tool-call-level tests beyond registration; the
    lifespan hook's `pool.close_all()` on shutdown, driven through
    FastMCP's actual lifespan protocol rather than only unit-testing
    `ClientPool.close_all()` in isolation; `netwatch`'s and `lte_status`'s
    "optional package absent" `DeviceCommandError → empty` fallback (the
    existing tests for this used `FakeConnection`'s path-keyed `raise_for`,
    which doesn't intercept `lte_monitor`'s callable-form read - fixed to
    use `TransportErrorConnection`, which does); `torch`'s unparseable
    `tx`/`rx` handling (treated as 0 traffic, sorted last, not dropped).
  - Two lines legitimately excluded via `# pragma: no cover`, not chased
    with contrived tests: the process entrypoint (`main()`/`if __name__ ==
    "__main__":` in `server.py`, which blocks on stdio) and
    `__init__.py`'s `except PackageNotFoundError` fallback (only reachable
    when imported without being installed at all).
- **Contributor onboarding**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` (setup, the full
  security-model checklist every write-tool PR must satisfy, and a
  step-by-step guide for adding a new read or write tool),
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` + `feature_request.md`,
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor
  Covenant 2.1), and `SECURITY.md` (private vulnerability reporting via
  GitHub Security Advisories, scoped to this project's specific threat
  model - write-guard bypass, secret-in-log/journal, command injection,
  TLS-verification bypass).
- **README**: CI/Python-version/coverage/license badges at the top; the
  "Development & CI" section rewritten to describe all three CI jobs and
  the 95% coverage floor; test count updated (1128, up from 988).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-10

The first stable release. Every tool round planned since v0.1.0 has
shipped - see every entry below for the full detail - and this release adds
no new tool; it is a polish/consolidation pass over what's already there:

- **71 tools total** (42 read-only, 29 guarded write) across device
  identity/interfaces, IPv4 routing + failover, DHCP, wireless (ROS6/ROS7),
  bandwidth (Simple Queue), firewall address-lists + NAT + filter-rule
  toggle + connection tracking, physical layer/PoE, LTE/5G, containers,
  USB, VPN (WireGuard/PPP/IPsec) + BGP/OSPF, Netwatch, static DNS + cache,
  Wake-on-LAN, a heuristic security audit + security-relevant log events,
  hotspot vouchers + live sessions, live traffic monitoring (torch), and
  RouterOS backups.
- **The security model is unchanged and unweakened from v0.5 onward**:
  read-only by default (`MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE=false`), a central allowlist
  with no generic "run this command" tool, explicit `confirm`/preview on
  every write, structured-API-only device access (no shell/SSH, no command
  injection surface), a secret-redacting audit journal, read-only retry,
  and a per-device circuit breaker. See the consolidated "Security model"
  section in `README.md`.
- **`remove_netwatch` ambiguity handling** (`guard.py`): now resolves by
  `host` (or `comment`) with the same rigor as the route/firewall-rule/DNS
  resolvers - if more than one Netwatch monitor still matches after
  resolution, it raises `AmbiguousResourceError` instead of silently acting
  on the first match. Previously this was the one resolver in `guard.py`
  still using first-match-wins.
- **`WritePreview.warning` now reaches the audit journal** (`guard.py`,
  `_audited`): a write's risk callout (e.g. `disable_route`'s default-route
  warning, `remove_dhcp_lease`'s static-lease warning) is now part of the
  journaled `summary`, not just the tool's own return value - so the audit
  trail alone can reconstruct the same warning a caller saw at call time.
  `summary.warning` is `null` for writes that carry no special risk. Still
  plain text describing the operation, never a credential - covered by the
  same `audit._sanitize()` redaction as `before`/`after`.
- **`__version__` is now derived from installed package metadata**
  (`src/mcp_mikrotik/__init__.py`, via `importlib.metadata.version()`, with
  a hardcoded `"1.0.0"` fallback if the package isn't installed at all) -
  `pyproject.toml`'s `[project] version` is now the single source of truth;
  nothing to keep in sync by hand across two files anymore.
- **README rewritten for a public 1.0**: a clear overview + philosophy
  statement, `pip`/`uv` install instructions with RouterOS version
  requirements, a complete environment-variable table, a complete
  read/write tools reference table (all 71), a consolidated "Security
  model" section (folding in what was a separate "Production features"
  section), an MCP client connection example (Claude Desktop
  `claude_desktop_config.json` + Claude Code) with example interactions, an
  explicit "Non-goals" section, and a "Delivered through 1.0" roadmap
  summary.
- Test suite: 988 tests (984 carried over, plus 4 new - two
  `remove_netwatch` ambiguity cases and two audit-journal `warning`
  assertions), all passing against the in-memory fake device layer.

## [0.14.0] - Unreleased

The last feature round before 1.0: hotspot visitor vouchers (with a
QR-renderable payload), a live traffic monitor (torch), and RouterOS system
backups. Three new read-only tools (`hotspot_active`, `torch`,
`list_backups`) and two new guarded write tools (`add_hotspot_user`,
`create_backup`). Same write-guard mechanism as every previous round
(read-only default, central allowlist, confirm/preview, audit journal - none
of it weakened or bypassed), plus one deliberate, documented exception to
this package's usual secret-handling rule: a hotspot voucher's plaintext
password IS returned to the caller (that's the whole point of a voucher),
but still never reaches the audit journal.

### Added

- **`hotspot_active`** (read, `server.py`): lists clients currently logged
  into the RouterOS hotspot (`/ip/hotspot/active`) - `user`, `address`,
  `mac-address`, `uptime`, `bytes-in`/`bytes-out`. Empty list (not an error)
  for a device with no hotspot server configured, or no one logged in right
  now - same convention as `ppp_active`/`ipsec_active_peers`.
- **`torch`** (read, `server.py` + `client.py`): a live traffic snapshot of
  one `interface` (`/tool/torch interface=<interface> once=yes`) - "who is
  consuming bandwidth on this link RIGHT NOW". Built the same "once"
  monitor-style way as `interface_traffic`/`poe_status`/`lte_status`
  (`MikrotikClient.torch`, materializing librouteros' generator reply with
  `list(...)` before inspecting it - the same v0.7.1 lesson those three
  already established), but unlike them a torch snapshot can genuinely carry
  MANY rows (one per flow), not just one. Optional `src_address`/
  `dst_address`/`port` filters are forwarded to RouterOS itself, narrowing
  the snapshot BEFORE it ever leaves the device. Regardless of how many
  flows matched, the result's `flows` list is sorted by total traffic
  (tx+rx, biggest talkers first) and hard-capped at 50 entries -
  `truncated`/`total_matched` report whether/how much was cut, the same
  "cap it, tell the caller how many really matched" shape
  `connection_tracking` (v0.11) already established.
- **`list_backups`** (read, `server.py`): lists backup files on the device
  (`/file`, filtered to names ending in `.backup`) - `name`, `size`,
  `creation-time`. Empty list (not an error) with no backup files.
- **`add_hotspot_user`** (write, guarded, `guard.py` + `server.py`): creates
  a hotspot voucher user (`/ip/hotspot/user add` - `name`, `password`,
  optional `profile`/`limit_uptime`/`limit_bytes_total`) for a visitor.
  Refuses to create a duplicate `name` (`ResourceAlreadyExistsError`).
  **QR/voucher**: the tool result always also includes `username`,
  `password`, and `qr_payload` - a plain `"<username>:<password>"` string
  the caller renders as a QR code itself (this package deliberately does
  NOT generate a QR image - no extra imaging dependency). A login-URL or
  `WIFI:` payload were both considered and rejected - see
  `server.py`'s `add_hotspot_user` docstring for why. **The deliberate
  password asymmetry**: unlike every secret this package has handled before
  (a device password, a WireGuard private-key - never returned to any
  caller at all), this voucher's plaintext `password` IS present in the
  tool's own return value (the caller needs it to hand to a visitor) - but
  it must still never reach the audit journal. No new redaction code was
  needed for that: `audit._SENSITIVE_KEY` already matches "password"
  case-insensitively at any depth of the journaled summary, so the exact
  same `after` dict returned to the caller gets its `password` key silently
  dropped before `audit.record()` ever sees it. See
  `tests/test_guard_audit.py`'s
  `test_add_hotspot_user_password_never_in_audit_journal` and
  `tests/test_server.py`'s
  `test_add_hotspot_user_password_in_result_but_never_in_audit_journal` for
  the proof, at both the guard layer and the full MCP tool-call boundary.
- **`create_backup`** (write, guarded): creates a RouterOS system backup
  file (`/system/backup/save name=<name>`, optional encryption `password`).
  A third ACTION-command allowlist entry (after `start`/`stop`, v0.7, and
  `flush`/`wol`, v0.10) - `"save"` is RouterOS's own literal command word,
  dispatched through the same `getattr(client, op.action)` mechanism as
  every other guarded write (`MikrotikClient.save`, new). Refuses to
  overwrite an existing `.backup` file of the same name
  (`ResourceAlreadyExistsError`) - RouterOS itself would silently overwrite
  one. `password` (the backup FILE's own encryption option, unrelated to any
  device/API credential) is redacted **before** the `WritePreview` is ever
  constructed - the same "redact before constructing the preview" rule
  v0.13's WireGuard round established for private/preshared keys - so it
  never reaches the caller or the journal.

### Changed

- `guard.ALLOWLIST`'s `WriteOperation.action` now also accepts `"save"`
  (`create_backup`) alongside the existing `update`/`add`/`remove`/`start`/
  `stop`/`flush`/`wol` set - `tests/test_guard.py`'s
  `test_allowlist_only_contains_named_operations` and
  `tests/test_server.py`'s `test_server_never_calls_write_primitives_directly`
  (the meta-test enumerating every write-primitive method name) were both
  updated accordingly.

### Non-goals (still deliberately not exposed)

- **Backup restore** (`/system/backup/load`): same risk class as reboot -
  loading a backup overwrites the device's entire running configuration and
  reboots it, with no meaningful before/after preview and no rollback.
  Restoring a backup stays a manual, on-device (WinBox/CLI) operation until
  it has its own confirmation/cooldown policy.

## [0.13.0] - Unreleased

WireGuard VPN management round - the most security-sensitive round to date,
since WireGuard uses **private keys**. One new read tool
(`wireguard_interfaces`) and three new guarded write tools
(`add_wireguard_interface`, `add_wireguard_peer`, `remove_wireguard_peer`).
Same write-guard mechanism as every previous round (read-only default,
central allowlist, confirm/preview, audit journal - none of it weakened or
bypassed), plus a security invariant unique to this round: no tool, error
message, preview, or audit journal entry may EVER contain a private-key or
preshared-key.

### Added

- **`wireguard_interfaces`** (read, `server.py`): lists `/interface/wireguard`
  - name, listen-port, public-key, running, disabled, mtu. **SECURITY**:
  unlike `wireguard_peers` (v0.8), RouterOS's own reply for THIS menu
  genuinely carries a `private-key` field - always stripped before
  returning, via `formatting.strip_sensitive_fields` with the new
  `formatting.WIREGUARD_SENSITIVE_FIELDS` constant (`{"private-key",
  "preshared-key"}`, shared between this tool, `wireguard_peers`, and every
  WireGuard write tool's redaction below). `wireguard_peers` itself is
  unchanged in shape but now also strips a peer's `preshared-key` (a real,
  optional field on that menu this package previously didn't defend
  against). Empty list (never an error) for a device with no WireGuard
  package/interfaces - same convention as `wireguard_peers`.
- **`add_wireguard_interface`** (write, guarded, `guard.py` + `server.py`):
  creates a WireGuard tunnel interface (`/interface/wireguard add` - `name`,
  optional `listen_port`). RouterOS generates the interface's private key
  internally on creation - this tool has NO `private_key` parameter at all
  (not "rejected if given", genuinely absent from the function signature -
  same "no code path to smuggle a secret through" pattern v0.9's
  `add_netwatch` used for up-script/down-script), and never returns one. The
  `confirm=false` preview's `after` deliberately does not invent a
  `public-key` (RouterOS hasn't generated the key pair yet at preview time)
  - only `name`/`listen-port` (if given). The `confirm=true` applied result
  re-reads the newly created interface and reports its real `public-key`
  (safe to share with a remote peer), with `private-key` always stripped by
  `guard._redact_wireguard_row` **before** the `WritePreview` is
  constructed - see "How the private-key redaction is enforced" below for
  why that ordering is the whole point. Refuses to create a second interface
  sharing `name` (`ResourceAlreadyExistsError`).
- **`add_wireguard_peer`** (write, guarded): adds a peer
  (`/interface/wireguard/peers add`) to an existing tunnel `interface` - the
  remote peer's `public_key` (validated as a 44-character base64 WireGuard
  key - `validation.validate_wireguard_key`), `allowed_address` (a
  comma-separated CIDR list - `validation.validate_allowed_address_list`),
  and optional `endpoint_address`/`endpoint_port`/`persistent_keepalive`/
  `comment`. Has NO `private_key` or `preshared_key` parameter either - the
  remote peer's own private key, and any preshared key, are entirely out of
  this tool's scope. `interface` must already exist
  (`/interface/wireguard`) - raises `ResourceNotFoundError` otherwise; never
  creates one. Refuses to add a duplicate peer - the same `public_key`
  already registered on the same `interface` - raises
  `ResourceAlreadyExistsError` instead.
- **`remove_wireguard_peer`** (write, guarded): removes a peer
  (`/interface/wireguard/peers remove`) from `interface`, resolved by
  `public_key` or `comment` (`public_key` tried first if both are given,
  scoped to `interface` so a peer sharing a public-key on a DIFFERENT
  interface never matches). `ResourceNotFoundError` if nothing matches;
  `AmbiguousResourceError` if more than one peer still matches after
  narrowing (e.g. two peers sharing a `comment` on the same interface) -
  never guesses which one to remove.
- `validation.validate_port` (listen-port/endpoint-port, 1-65535),
  `validation.validate_wireguard_key` (a 44-character base64 WireGuard key
  shape - used ONLY for a caller-supplied PUBLIC key; this package never
  accepts a private/preshared key as a parameter, so there is no validator
  for one either), `validation.validate_allowed_address_list` (a
  comma-separated CIDR list, each entry validated via the existing
  `validate_target`) - all new, `src/mcp_mikrotik/validation.py`.
- `formatting.WIREGUARD_SENSITIVE_FIELDS` (new): the shared
  `{"private-key", "preshared-key"}` constant `server.py`'s read tools and
  `guard.py`'s write-preview redaction both use, so the two paths can never
  drift out of sync with each other.

### How the private-key/preshared-key redaction is enforced (two independent layers)

1. **`formatting.strip_sensitive_fields`** (with the new
   `WIREGUARD_SENSITIVE_FIELDS`) is applied to every WireGuard row this
   package ever returns or journals - both read tools
   (`wireguard_interfaces`/`wireguard_peers`, `server.py`) and every write
   tool's before/after preview, via a new `guard._redact_wireguard_row`
   helper.
2. **Redaction happens INSIDE `guard.py`, before a `WritePreview` is ever
   constructed - not one layer up in `server.py`.** This is the critical
   ordering: the write-guard's `_audited` decorator (v0.5) journals exactly
   whatever a `guard.py` function returns. If redaction only happened in
   `server.py` (after `guard.py` already returned), a private-key would
   already be sitting in the audit journal (a file on disk, or a stderr log
   line) by the time `server.py` got a chance to strip it. So
   `add_wireguard_interface` redacts the freshly-created interface row
   BEFORE building the `WritePreview` the decorator logs -
   `guard._redact_wireguard_row` runs first, every time.
3. **`audit._SENSITIVE_KEY`** (extended this round: added a `private` term,
   on top of the existing `pre.?shared` term that already covered
   `preshared-key`/`pre-shared-key`/`presharedkey`) is a SECOND, independent
   line of defense on top of (1)/(2) - not a substitute for it. If a future
   write function ever forgot to redact before returning, this regex is
   what stands between that and a leaked key reaching the journal.

`add_wireguard_interface`/`add_wireguard_peer` also have no code path to
leak a key a different way: neither function has a `private_key` parameter
at all (and `add_wireguard_peer` has no `preshared_key` parameter either) -
see `test_add_wireguard_interface_never_accepts_a_private_key_parameter`/
`test_add_wireguard_peer_never_accepts_a_private_key_or_preshared_key_parameter`
(`tests/test_guard.py`, assert `TypeError` for either kwarg), mirroring
v0.9's `add_netwatch` up-script/down-script guarantee.

### Tests

54 new tests (869 → 923, full suite green): `validate_port`/
`validate_wireguard_key`/`validate_allowed_address_list` (accept/reject);
`wireguard_interfaces` (happy path, the explicit private-key-redaction
proof, empty-for-no-WireGuard) and `wireguard_peers`'
`preshared-key`-redaction proof (`tests/test_server.py`); guard-level
coverage for all three new writes (blocked when read-only, read-only gate
before touching the device, preview vs confirm, `ALLOWLIST.action`-driven
dispatch, name/public-key duplicate → `ResourceAlreadyExistsError`,
unknown-interface/unknown-peer → `ResourceNotFoundError`, ambiguous-comment
→ `AmbiguousResourceError`, the no-private-key-parameter guarantee); audit
journal coverage (preview/applied/error outcomes, folded into the existing
cross-tool no-password-leak sweep - now 27 events) plus a dedicated
**CRITICAL security test**,
`test_add_wireguard_interface_confirmed_call_never_leaks_private_key_into_journal`
(`tests/test_guard_audit.py`) and its end-to-end counterpart,
`test_add_wireguard_interface_never_leaks_private_key_anywhere`
(`tests/test_server.py`): `tests/fakes.py`'s `FakePath.add()` now simulates
RouterOS genuinely generating a key pair - including a
distinctively-marked private-key - on `/interface/wireguard add` (a fake
`add()` that only echoed back the fields it was given would never produce a
private-key for the redaction to strip in the first place, making the leak
test vacuous), and both tests assert that marker never reaches the tool's
own return value, the audit journal's `before` AND `after`, or any other
log line.

## [0.12.0] - Unreleased

Security audit round: two new READ-ONLY tools, `security_audit` and
`security_events` (both new `src/mcp_mikrotik/security.py`) - the "analyze
this router's security" use case. Neither tool is gated by
`MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE` and neither changes device state; both report
findings for a human/LLM operator to act on. The security model itself
(read-only gate, central write allowlist, confirm/preview) is unchanged -
this round adds no new write capability at all.

### Added

- **`security_audit`** (read, `server.py` + `security.py`): aggregates
  seven independent, defensive checks into `{"findings": [{"severity",
  "category", "title", "detail", "recommendation"}, ...], "summary":
  {"high", "medium", "low", "info"}}`, `findings` sorted by severity (high
  first):
  1. Insecure management services (`/ip/service`: telnet/ftp/www/api
     enabled - `high`/`medium`/`low` depending on protocol and whether
     `address` is open to any origin; winbox open to any origin is its own
     `medium`).
  2. Firewall input chain with no final drop/reject rule (`/ip/firewall/
     filter` chain=input) - a conservative, order-based heuristic,
     explicitly not a certainty claim - `medium`.
  3. SNMP community open (`/snmp/community`: default name `public` or no
     `addresses` restriction) - `medium`.
  4. DNS resolver open to remote requests (`/ip/dns`
     `allow-remote-requests=yes`) - `medium`.
  5. RouterOS not on the latest version (`/system/package/update`) - `low`.
  6. Open wireless/wifi (ROS6 `/interface/wireless/security-profiles`
     `mode=none`; ROS7 `/interface/wifi/security` with no passphrase AND no
     `authentication-types`) - `high`.
  7. Users with a write/full policy (`/user`) - `info`, visibility only.

  Every check reads its own menu(s) and treats `DeviceCommandError` (menu
  absent on this device/RouterOS generation) as "nothing to report" rather
  than an error - one unavailable check never stops the rest of the audit,
  the same convention `system_health`/`poe_status`/`wireless_registrations`
  already use for optional hardware/menus. **No finding ever contains a
  secret**: `/ip/service`, `/snmp/community`, the wireless/wifi security
  menus, and `/user` can all carry a password/passphrase/community-string-
  shaped field, but every finding's text comes from a fixed template
  referencing only non-secret fields (name, mode, address restriction,
  boolean presence checks, counts) - see `tests/test_security.py`'s
  `test_run_security_audit_never_leaks_a_secret`. **Heuristic, not a
  scanner**: findings prompt a review, they are not ground truth - see
  README's "Security audit" section for the full disclaimer, especially
  around check #2's rule-order-based heuristic.

- **`security_events`** (read, `server.py` + `security.py`): filters
  `/log` down to security-relevant entries - topic `account` (RouterOS's
  own topic for login/logout/authentication-failure events), `critical`/
  `error` topics, and a generic `system,info` entry whose message looks
  like a login/logout. Same filter-then-cut ordering `logs`' `topics`
  filter already documents, so the most recent `limit` MATCHING entries are
  returned (never the last `limit` raw entries filtered afterward). `limit`
  is positive, capped at 500 (default 50) - same shape as `logs`' own
  `limit`.

- `tests/test_security.py` (new, 47 tests): unit-level coverage of every
  individual check (fires/doesn't fire per fixture, skips cleanly when its
  menu is absent), `run_security_audit`'s sorting/summary/resilience (every
  menu absent at once still returns a well-formed empty result), the
  no-secret-leak guarantee, and `filter_security_events`'s topic/message
  matching and filter-before-limit ordering. `tests/test_server.py` gains
  end-to-end tool-call smoke tests for both tools (registration, not gated
  by the read-only setting, severity sorting, `limit` validation).

### Notes

- Both v0.12 tools are purely additive to the read-tool inventory - no
  existing tool's behavior, the write-guard mechanism, or `guard.ALLOWLIST`
  changed in this round.

## [0.11.0] - Unreleased

SAFE firewall control round: two new guarded write tools -
`enable_firewall_rule`/`disable_firewall_rule` - and one new filtered read
tool - `connection_tracking`. Same write-guard mechanism as every previous
round (read-only default, central allowlist, confirm/preview, audit
journal, no secrets logged) - none of it weakened or bypassed; the firewall
tools' `action` stays a plain `"update"` (no new dispatch mechanism), so
they need none of the `getattr(client, op.action)` extension work v0.7's
`start_container`/`stop_container` or v0.10's `clear_dns_cache`/
`wake_on_lan` needed.

### Added

- **`enable_firewall_rule`** / **`disable_firewall_rule`** (write, guarded,
  `src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py` + `server.py`): flip an EXISTING
  `/ip/firewall/filter` rule's `disabled` field (`/ip/firewall/filter set
  disabled=no|yes`) - resolved by the rule's `comment` (a STABLE,
  admin-controlled identifier), optionally narrowed by `chain` if more than
  one rule shares that comment. **Never creates a rule**: a `comment` that
  matches nothing raises `ResourceNotFoundError` (never falls back to
  creating one); a `comment` that still matches more than one row after
  narrowing raises `AmbiguousResourceError` - the tool never guesses which
  one to toggle. The returned preview's `before`/`after` are the FULL
  matched rule (every field RouterOS returned - `chain`/`action`/etc, not
  just `disabled`), so an operator can confirm WHICH rule this is before
  ever passing `confirm=true`.

  This is the community-suggested SAFE alternative to a general
  firewall-filter write tool (still deliberately absent - see
  `guard.ALLOWLIST`'s comment and README's "Roadmap / non-goals"): an admin
  creates a rule ahead of time on the device itself (e.g. `comment=
  "Bloqueio_Ataque_X"`, `disabled=yes`), reviews it once, and an LLM caller
  later enables it via `enable_firewall_rule` when it detects the condition
  the rule exists to guard against. If something goes wrong, the admin
  knows exactly which rule was toggled - the same one they already wrote
  and reviewed, never one this package authored on its own judgment. See
  README's "Firewall rule toggle (by comment)".

- **`connection_tracking`** (read, `server.py`): lists active connections
  from RouterOS's connection tracking table (`/ip/firewall/connection`).
  Unlike every other read tool in this package, a filter is MANDATORY - at
  least one of `src_address`/`dst_address`/`dst_port`/`protocol` must be
  given, or the tool raises `ValidationError` before ever touching the
  device. This exists specifically to avoid a community-reported gotcha:
  the full connection-tracking table on a production router can be large
  enough to blow straight past an LLM caller's context/token budget on its
  own. Filtering happens client-side after reading the table (the same
  reasoning `logs`' `topics` filter already documents - RouterOS's
  structured API doesn't expose a query-by-field read here either), and the
  result is hard-capped at `MAX_CONNTRACK_LIMIT` (100) rows regardless of
  how many match - the returned `truncated` field is `true` whenever more
  rows matched than were returned, and `total_matched` always reports the
  real, pre-truncation count.

  `src_address`/`dst_address` match a row's IP, ignoring the port RouterOS
  packs into the same field (e.g. `"192.0.2.1:80"`); `dst_port` matches the
  destination's port component. `protocol` is a RouterOS protocol name
  (case-insensitive) or a numeric IP protocol number (0-255). Each returned
  entry: `protocol`, `src-address`/`src-port`, `dst-address`/`dst-port`
  (address and port split apart - see `formatting.split_address_port`),
  `tcp-state` (populated for TCP connections), `timeout`, and the
  `assured`/`confirmed`/`seen-reply` flags - RouterOS's own closest
  equivalent to a generic "connection state" for this table. See README's
  "Connection tracking (filtered)".

- `validation.validate_firewall_rule_comment`/`validate_firewall_chain`
  (`src/mcp_mikrotik/validation.py`, new): a firewall filter rule's
  `comment` (MANDATORY and non-empty here, unlike `validate_comment`'s
  OPTIONAL free-text field elsewhere - an empty comment can never reliably
  identify one specific existing rule) and its `chain` (shape-only, not
  restricted to the three built-in chains - RouterOS allows arbitrary
  custom jump-target chains too).
- `validation.validate_conntrack_dst_port`/`validate_conntrack_protocol`
  (new): `connection_tracking`'s `dst_port` (integer, 1-65535) and
  `protocol` (a RouterOS protocol name, case-insensitive, or a numeric
  0-255 protocol number) filter values.
- `formatting.split_address_port` (new): splits a RouterOS
  connection-tracking address field ("192.0.2.1:80",
  "[2001:db8::1]:80", or a bare address with no port at all) into
  `(address, port)` - used by `connection_tracking` to report/filter
  address and port as separate values instead of RouterOS's packed format.

## [0.10.0] - Unreleased

DNS/DHCP/Wake-on-LAN **write** round: five new guarded write tools -
`add_static_dns`/`remove_static_dns` (`/ip/dns/static`), `clear_dns_cache`
(`/ip/dns/cache/flush`), `remove_dhcp_lease` (`/ip/dhcp-server/lease`), and
`wake_on_lan` (`/tool/wol`). Same write-guard mechanism as every previous
round (read-only default, central allowlist, confirm/preview, audit
journal, no secrets logged, ROS6/ROS7 compat - none of these five needed
any generation branching, since static DNS, DNS cache, DHCP leases, and
`/tool/wol` all live at the same path on both RouterOS generations) - none
of it weakened or bypassed. `clear_dns_cache`/`wake_on_lan` extend the
guard's action-command mechanism (first introduced by v0.7's
`start_container`/`stop_container`) a second time - see "How
`clear_dns_cache`/`wake_on_lan` extend the guard" below.

### Added

- **`add_static_dns`** (write, guarded, `src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py` +
  `server.py`): creates a static DNS entry (`/ip/dns/static add`) resolving
  `name` to `address`. `record_type` (default `"A"`) selects what `address`
  means - a literal IPv4/IPv6 address for `"A"`, or another hostname (the
  alias target, written to RouterOS's `cname` field) for `"CNAME"`. Typical
  uses: sinkhole a malicious domain (`address="0.0.0.0"`), or set up an
  internal DNS override/alias. Refuses to create a second row for the same
  `name`+`record_type` pair (`ResourceAlreadyExistsError`) - this tool only
  ever adds, never updates or removes an existing entry, and does not
  attempt to create RouterOS round-robin DNS (two "A" records sharing a
  `name`, different addresses) since that would require accepting a
  same-name-and-type "duplicate" as intentional.
- **`remove_static_dns`** (write, guarded): removes a static DNS entry by
  `name`, optionally narrowed by `record_type`. `ResourceNotFoundError` if
  nothing matches; `AmbiguousResourceError` if more than one row still
  matches after narrowing (e.g. an existing round-robin pair) - never
  guesses which one to remove.
- **`clear_dns_cache`** (write, guarded): flushes the device's DNS resolver
  cache (`/ip/dns/cache/flush`) - no arguments, targets no specific row
  (clears every cached answer at once). Benign (only cached *answers* are
  cleared, never configuration - they repopulate on the next resolution),
  but still confirm-gated like every other write tool here. `before`/`after`
  report the currently-cached entry count (`cached_entries`) as an
  informative read, not a specific row's fields - `after.cached_entries` is
  the *intended* post-flush count (`0`), not a verified re-read.
- **`remove_dhcp_lease`** (write, guarded): removes an existing
  `/ip/dhcp-server/lease` row by `address` or `mac_address` (`mac_address`
  tried first if both given - the more stable identifier). Typical use:
  force a client to renew its IP. Removes EITHER a dynamic or a static
  lease - not blocked outright for a static one - but the returned
  preview's new `warning` field is non-null whenever the resolved lease is
  static (`dynamic=false`): removing it deletes the pinned IP↔MAC mapping
  itself, not just a renewable entry. Set on both the `confirm=false`
  preview and the `confirm=true` applied result, same pattern as v0.9's
  `disable_route` default-route warning.
- **`wake_on_lan`** (write, guarded): sends a Wake-on-LAN magic packet
  (`/tool/wol`) for `mac_address`, out `interface`. The first guarded write
  in this package that resolves nothing on the device first - there is no
  existing row to check `mac_address`/`interface` against, only shape
  validation (`validate_mac_address`/`validate_interface_name`); RouterOS
  itself rejects an unknown `interface` at send time. Benign (never changes
  device configuration) but still confirm-gated, so an LLM caller can't
  wake a machine "by accident".
- `validation.validate_dns_name`/`validate_dns_record_type`
  (`src/mcp_mikrotik/validation.py`, new): hostname/domain shape (reused for
  both a static DNS entry's `name` and, when `record_type="CNAME"`, its
  `address`/alias-target param - unlike `validate_ping_address`, never
  accepts a literal IP), and the `"A"`/`"CNAME"` record-type enum
  (case-insensitive, normalized to upper-case). `add_static_dns`/
  `remove_static_dns` reuse the existing `validate_ip_address` (an `"A"`
  record's `address`), `validate_timeout` (`ttl`, reused - not a full
  RouterOS DNS TTL grammar, same best-effort duration/clock check already
  used for address-list `timeout`), and `validate_comment`. `remove_dhcp_lease`
  reuses `validate_ip_address`/`validate_mac_address`; `wake_on_lan` reuses
  `validate_mac_address`/`validate_interface_name` - no other new validators
  needed.
- `MikrotikClient.flush`/`.wol` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/client.py`, new): two more
  action-command write primitives, alongside `.start`/`.stop`. Unlike
  `.start`/`.stop` (which target one specific row's `.id` via
  `path(*segments)(cmd, **{".id": id})`), neither `/ip/dns/cache/flush` nor
  `/tool/wol` targets a row at all - both are standalone, one-shot commands,
  so `.flush`/`.wol` use the connection's CALLABLE form
  (`connection(cmd, **kwargs)`) instead, the same mechanism `ping`/
  `traceroute`/`monitor_traffic` already use. Each still sends exactly one
  fixed, hardcoded command string built only from a menu-path `segments`
  argument plus its own literal command word (`"flush"`/`"wol"`) - never a
  command assembled from caller input. No retry (same reasoning as every
  other write primitive). Reply is materialized with `list(...)` before
  being discarded, per the v0.7.1 lesson; `tests/fakes.py`'s
  `FakeConnection.__call__` now returns a real (empty) generator for
  `/ip/dns/cache/flush`/`/tool/wol` (reusing the existing
  `_once_reply_stream(None)` helper), so a regression back to
  unmaterialized indexing would fail the suite the same way v0.7.1's did.

### How `clear_dns_cache`/`wake_on_lan` extend the guard

These are the second pair of `ALLOWLIST` entries (after v0.7's
`start_container`/`stop_container`) whose `action` is neither `"update"`,
`"add"`, nor `"remove"` - `"flush"`/`"wol"` are RouterOS's own literal
command words for `/ip/dns/cache/flush`/`/tool/wol`, exactly the same
"`action` is a literal RouterOS command word" convention `"start"`/`"stop"`
established. Dispatch is unchanged: `ALLOWLIST["clear_dns_cache"].action ==
"flush"` and `ALLOWLIST["wake_on_lan"].action == "wol"` are what actually
get called, via the exact same `getattr(client, op.action)` indirection
every write here already uses - `guard.clear_dns_cache`/`.wake_on_lan` never
call `client.flush`/`.wol` directly. The one new wrinkle versus
`start`/`stop`: neither operation targets a specific `/container`-style row
by `.id` - see `MikrotikClient.flush`/`.wol`'s docstrings above for why they
use the connection's callable form instead of `start`/`stop`'s
`path(*segments)(cmd, **{".id": id})` form. Same read-only gate,
confirm/preview flow, and `_audited` journaling as every other write,
unchanged.

### Tests

105 new tests (627 → 732, full suite green): `validate_dns_name`/
`validate_dns_record_type` (accept/reject, including the deliberate
"a literal IP is rejected as a DNS name, unlike `validate_route_gateway`'s
interface-name exception" case); `MikrotikClient.flush`/`.wol` (fixed
command string / structured params not a command string, transport-error
wrapping, no retry - extending the existing "writes never retry"
parametrized case); guard-level coverage for all five new writes (blocked
when read-only, read-only gate before touching the device, preview vs
confirm, `ALLOWLIST.action`-driven dispatch, name+type duplicate →
`ResourceAlreadyExistsError`, round-robin ambiguity →
`AmbiguousResourceError`, not-found, the static-vs-dynamic DHCP lease
warning present/absent, `mac_address`-tried-before-`address` resolution
order); audit-journal coverage (preview/applied/error outcomes, no password
leak, folded into the existing cross-tool sweep - now 22 events); and
server-level `call_tool` coverage mirroring the guard-level cases end to
end through `FastMCP`, including the CNAME-writes-`cname`-not-`address`
case and the DHCP static-lease-warning case.

## [0.9.0] - Unreleased

Failover **write** round: the five atomic write tools v0.8's read-only
VPN/routing/Netwatch diagnostics were the foundation for -
`set_route_distance`, `enable_route`/`disable_route`, `add_netwatch`/
`remove_netwatch`. Deliberately small, composable steps an LLM caller
combines to build or adjust a failover setup - never one black-box "do a
failover" command. These writes touch **routing**: a wrong `disable_route`
call on the wrong route can cut a device's outbound traffic, so this round's
whole design is aimed at making that mistake hard to make -
resolution-by-stable-identifier (never a dynamic `.id`/index) and an
explicit default-route risk callout in the preview, on top of the unchanged
write-guard invariants (read-only default, central allowlist, confirm/
preview, audit journal, no secrets logged).

### Added

- **`set_route_distance`** (write, guarded, `src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py` +
  `server.py`): adjusts an existing `/ip/route` row's `distance` (failover
  priority - the lower distance wins) via `set distance=<distance>`.
  Resolved by the STABLE `(dst_address, gateway)` pair - never a dynamic
  `.id`/list index, which can silently shift as routes are added/removed
  elsewhere on the device between a preview and the confirmed apply (see
  "Route resolution: stable identifiers, never an index" below). `distance`
  is validated 1-255 (`validation.validate_route_distance`) before the
  device is ever touched.
- **`enable_route`/`disable_route`** (write, guarded): flip an `/ip/route`
  row's `disabled` field, resolved by `dst_address` - narrowed by optional
  `gateway`/`comment` when more than one route shares that `dst_address`
  (exactly the failover shape: two default routes to different gateways).
  **`disable_route`'s preview carries a `warning` field** (a new, optional
  `WritePreview.warning: str | None` on `guard.WritePreview`, `None` for
  every write that has no equivalent risk) whenever the resolved route's
  `dst-address` is a default route (`0.0.0.0/0`/`::/0`) - a plain-language
  callout that disabling it cuts outbound traffic through that gateway, set
  on both the `confirm=false` preview and the `confirm=true` applied result
  so a caller reading only `applied`/`after` still cannot miss it.
  `enable_route` never carries a warning - re-enabling restores traffic
  rather than cutting it.
- **`add_netwatch`** (write, guarded): creates a `/tool/netwatch` host
  monitor - `host` (validated as a plain IP, `validate_ip_address`),
  optional `interval` (a RouterOS duration, reuses `validate_timeout`) and
  optional `comment`. **SECURITY: does NOT accept an up-script/down-script
  parameter at all** - there is no parameter on this tool a caller could
  even attempt to pass one through (see "Netwatch scripts are never
  accepted" below). Refuses to create a second monitor for a `host` that
  already has one (`ResourceAlreadyExistsError`).
- **`remove_netwatch`** (write, guarded): removes a `/tool/netwatch` row by
  `host` or `comment` (`host` tried first if both given). Requires at least
  one of the two; `ResourceNotFoundError` if neither matches.
- `exceptions.AmbiguousResourceError` (new): raised when a write tool's
  identifier matches more than one row on the device instead of the tool
  guessing which to touch - see "Route resolution" below. Mirrors the
  existing `ResourceNotFoundError`/`ResourceAlreadyExistsError` shape
  (device name, resource kind/name, plus the list of ambiguous candidates).
- `validation.validate_dst_address`/`validate_route_gateway`/
  `validate_route_distance` (new): route `dst-address` (IPv4/IPv6, optional
  `/prefix`), `gateway` (IPv4/IPv6 address OR a bare interface name -
  RouterOS also accepts a gateway expressed as an outgoing interface), and
  `distance` (integer 1-255). `add_netwatch`/`remove_netwatch` reuse the
  existing `validate_ip_address` (host) and `validate_timeout` (interval) -
  no new validators needed for those two fields.

### Route resolution: stable identifiers, never an index

All three route write tools share one resolver, `guard._resolve_route`:
match `/ip/route` rows by `dst-address`, then narrow further by `gateway`
and/or `comment` if given. **Never** by `.id` (RouterOS reassigns `.id`s as
routes are added/removed elsewhere on the device - stale between a preview
and a later confirmed apply) and never by a list index (even less stable -
shifts on every unrelated route change). If nothing matches after
narrowing, `ResourceNotFoundError`. If **more than one** row still matches
- the common real case is two routes sharing a `dst-address` for failover,
e.g. two `0.0.0.0/0` default routes pointing at different gateways -
`AmbiguousResourceError` is raised instead of silently picking the first
match; the caller must add (or correct) `gateway`/`comment` to disambiguate.
`set_route_distance` requires `gateway` up front (you're always adjusting a
*specific* gateway's priority); `enable_route`/`disable_route` accept it
(and `comment`) as optional narrowers, since sometimes `dst_address` alone
is already unambiguous.

### Netwatch scripts are never accepted

`add_netwatch`'s function signature (`guard.py` and its `server.py` tool
wrapper) has no `up_script`/`down_script` parameter at all - not "rejected
if given", genuinely absent, so there is no code path through which a
caller can smuggle an executable RouterOS script (which can run arbitrary
commands, including route or credential changes) onto a device via this
tool. See `test_add_netwatch_never_accepts_up_script_or_down_script`
(`tests/test_guard.py`, asserts `TypeError` for either kwarg) and
`test_add_netwatch_tool_schema_has_no_up_script_or_down_script_parameter`
(`tests/test_server.py`, asserts the MCP tool's own JSON parameter schema
has no such property). Up/down scripts remain a manual, out-of-band
operator step (WinBox/CLI) once the monitor exists - see README's
"Failover control".

### Tests

112 new tests (515 → 627, full suite green): `validate_dst_address`/
`validate_route_gateway`/`validate_route_distance` (accept/reject,
including the deliberate "999.1.1.1 is accepted as an interface-name shape,
not a malformed IP" edge case - see its test's docstring); guard-level
coverage for all five new writes (blocked when read-only, read-only gate
before touching the device, preview vs confirm, resolution by
`dst-address`+`gateway`, ambiguity → `AmbiguousResourceError`, not-found,
netwatch duplicate → `ResourceAlreadyExistsError`, the default-route
warning present/absent, `ALLOWLIST.action`-driven dispatch); audit-journal
coverage (preview/applied/error outcomes, no password leak, folded into the
existing cross-tool sweep); server-level `call_tool` coverage mirroring the
guard-level cases end to end through `FastMCP`, plus the netwatch
schema-inspection test above.

## [0.8.0] - Unreleased

VPN, routing, and failover diagnostics round: six new read tools covering
every VPN mechanism RouterOS supports (WireGuard, PPP-based VPN servers,
IPsec), plus BGP/OSPF routing-protocol status and Netwatch host monitoring -
the piece that actually drives failover decisions on a real device. **All
six are read-only** - none of them are gated by `MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE`, none
touch `guard.ALLOWLIST`. The write side of failover (adjusting a route's
`distance`, adding/editing a Netwatch entry) is deliberately deferred to a
future round; see README's "VPN & routing diagnostics" for why these reads
come first.

### Added

- **`wireguard_peers`** (read, `src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py`): lists
  `/interface/wireguard/peers` - name, interface, public-key,
  endpoint-address/endpoint-port, current-endpoint-address/
  current-endpoint-port, last-handshake, rx/tx byte counters,
  allowed-address, disabled. **SECURITY**: a `private-key` field never
  appears on RouterOS's own `/interface/wireguard/peers` reply (only
  `/interface/wireguard` - the tunnel interfaces themselves, deliberately
  NOT exposed by any read tool this round - carries one), but the tool
  strips a `private-key` field defensively regardless, via a new shared
  helper, `formatting.strip_sensitive_fields`. See
  `test_wireguard_peers_never_exposes_private_key` (`tests/test_server.py`),
  which feeds a fake device row that includes a `private-key` field and
  asserts it never reaches the tool's output. Empty list (never an error)
  for a device with no WireGuard package/interfaces.
- **`ppp_active`** (read): lists `/ppp/active` - name, service
  (l2tp/pptp/sstp/ovpn/pppoe), caller-id, address, uptime. Covers VPN
  server sessions currently connected to the device. Empty list (not an
  error) with no PPP server configured or no active sessions.
- **`ipsec_active_peers`** (read): lists `/ip/ipsec/active-peers` -
  remote-address, state, uptime, rx/tx byte counters, side
  (initiator/responder). Empty list (not an error) for a device that
  doesn't use IPsec.
- **`bgp_sessions`** (read): BGP session status - remote-address,
  remote-as, state (established/idle/...), uptime, prefix-count. RouterOS
  splits this by generation exactly like v0.6's `wireless_registrations`
  split wifi: ROS7's `/routing/bgp/session` vs ROS6's `/routing/bgp/peer`.
  Tries ROS7 first, falls back to ROS6, empty list (not an error) for a
  device that doesn't run BGP at all.
- **`ospf_neighbors`** (read): lists `/routing/ospf/neighbor` - address,
  state (Full/Down/...), router-id, adjacency. Empty list (not an error)
  for a device that doesn't run OSPF.
- **`netwatch`** (read): lists `/tool/netwatch` - host, status (up/down),
  interval, since, comment, disabled, plus `has-up-script`/
  `has-down-script` presence booleans. The up-script/down-script fields are
  surfaced only as presence booleans, never as the raw script body (which
  can contain arbitrary RouterOS commands, e.g. route or credential
  changes, that don't belong in a read tool's output). Netwatch is the
  mechanism a RouterOS device itself already uses to watch a gateway or
  peer's reachability - this is the key read for failover diagnosis; empty
  list (not an error) with no entries configured.
- `formatting.strip_sensitive_fields` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/formatting.py`,
  new): shared helper that drops a given set of field names from every row
  before it is returned - used by `wireguard_peers` to guarantee a private
  key can never leak, belt-and-suspenders on top of RouterOS's own reply
  shape never including one in the first place.

### Read-only, unlike everything else in this round's theme

Every tool above uses the same `try: rows_to_list(client.path(*segments))
except DeviceCommandError: return []` (or the ROS7-then-ROS6 fallback loop,
for `bgp_sessions`) shape `wireless_registrations`/`system_health`/
`lte_status` already established - a device that doesn't run the relevant
feature at all returns an empty list, never a raised error. None of the six
enters `guard.ALLOWLIST`, none checks `MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE`, none is
wrapped by `guard._audited` (the write-guard's audit journal only journals
writes - see v0.5's "Production features"). The actual failover write tools
(adjusting `ip_routes`' `distance` to fail over between gateways, adding/
editing a Netwatch entry) are intentionally left for a future round; these
six reads are the diagnostic foundation they will build on.

### Fixed / carried forward from the v0.7.1 lesson

v0.7.1 found that `tests/fakes.py`'s `FakeConnection.__call__` (the
callable-connection form used by `monitor_traffic`/`poe_monitor`/
`lte_monitor`) previously returned a `list` where real librouteros returns a
generator, hiding a real `TypeError` from the fake suite. None of this
round's six tools use that callable form at all - every one reads via
`MikrotikClient.path()` (`client.py`'s `path()`, already returning
`list[dict[str, Any]]` by materializing each row with `dict(row)` - see
`client.py:325`), the same construction `wireless_registrations`/
`arp_table`/`bridge_hosts` already use safely. `tests/fakes.py` is
unchanged this round; no new generator-vs-list gap was introduced.

### Tests

14 new tests (501 → 515, full suite green): `wireguard_peers` (happy path,
the explicit private-key-redaction proof, empty-for-no-WireGuard);
`ppp_active`/`ipsec_active_peers`/`ospf_neighbors` (happy path + empty for
device without the feature); `bgp_sessions` (ROS7 happy path, ROS6
fallback, empty when neither path exists - mirroring
`wireless_registrations`' three-case coverage); `netwatch` (happy path
proving `has-up-script`/`has-down-script` booleans replace the raw
`up-script`/`down-script` fields, empty for no entries). All new tools are
exercised end to end through `server.py`'s `call_tool`, against
`tests/fakes.py`'s existing `FakeConnection`/`raise_for` mechanism - no
changes to `tests/fakes.py` itself were needed.

## [0.7.1] - Unreleased

Patch round: four bugs found testing v0.7.0 against real hardware (a ROS7
mANTBox at a lab IP and a ROS6 OmniTik), none of them caught by the
in-memory fake device suite because the fakes didn't match real
librouteros/RouterOS behavior closely enough. The write-guard mechanism
itself (read-only default, central allowlist, confirm/preview, audit
journal) is unchanged - every fix below tightens it, none weakens or
bypasses it.

### Fixed

- **`interface_traffic`/`poe_status`/`lte_status` raised `TypeError` on
  every real device (CRITICAL)** - `src/mcp_mikrotik/client.py`
  (`MikrotikClient.monitor_traffic`/`.poe_monitor`/`.lte_monitor`):
  librouteros' callable connection form (`connection(cmd, **kwargs)`)
  returns a **generator**, not a list - always truthy, never subscriptable.
  The old `replies[0] if replies else {}` on that raw generator raised
  `TypeError: 'generator' object is not subscriptable` on every call
  against real hardware (100% failure rate for these three read tools).
  Fixed by materializing with `list(connection(...))` first, exactly like
  `ping`/`traceroute` already did. `tests/fakes.py`'s
  `FakeConnection.__call__` previously returned a `list` for these three
  commands, which is why the fake suite never caught this - it now returns
  a real generator (`_once_reply_stream`), so a regression back to
  `replies[0]` would fail the suite again.
- **`set_wifi_ssid` rejected on ROS7 with a named `configuration`
  (CRITICAL)** - `src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py`: on ROS7's standard production
  wifi layout, `/interface/wifi` interfaces reference a named
  `configuration` (e.g. `configuration=cfg1`) and have **no writable
  `ssid` field of their own** - the write was rejected by RouterOS
  ("unknown parameter ssid"). The ssid actually lives on the referenced
  `/interface/wifi/configuration` row. `set_wifi_ssid` now resolves this
  server-side: it reads the matched interface's own `configuration` field,
  looks up the matching `/interface/wifi/configuration` row by name, and
  reads/writes the ssid there - backed by a new allowlist entry,
  `set_wifi_ssid_ros7_configuration` (`("interface", "wifi",
  "configuration")`, action `update`), resolved the same way as every
  other guarded write (`_require_allowed` + `getattr(client, op.action)`
  dispatch, never a caller-supplied path). The `before`/`after` preview
  always reflects the ssid's real location - never a synthesized field
  that doesn't exist on the device. A wifi interface with no named
  `configuration` at all (rare/legacy) keeps writing an inline `ssid`
  field, unchanged. An unresolvable `configuration` name raises
  `ResourceNotFoundError`; an interface with neither an inline `ssid` nor a
  `configuration` reference raises a clear `DeviceCommandError` instead of
  sending a write RouterOS would itself reject. See README's "ROS7 wifi:
  `configuration`-based SSID".
- **WPA2 passphrase leaked into the audit journal (SECURITY)** -
  `src/mcp_mikrotik/audit.py` (`_SENSITIVE_KEY`): the sensitive-key regex
  covered `password`/`secret`/`token`/`credential` but not `passphrase` -
  `set_wifi_ssid`'s ROS7-`configuration` preview/apply (see above) reads
  the configuration row as `before`/`after`, and a real device's row can
  carry the WPA2 key under `passphrase`/`security.passphrase`. Extended
  the regex to also strip `passphrase`, `psk`, and any `pre-shared`/
  `pre_shared`/`preshared` spelling (covers `wpa-pre-shared-key`,
  `wpa2-pre-shared-key`, `pre-shared-key`, `pre_shared_key`, `preshared`
  case-insensitively) - recursively, nested included, same as
  `password`/`secret` already were.
- **`start_container`/`stop_container` leaked a raw device error on a
  device with no container support** - `src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py`
  (`_set_container_running`): `client.path(*op.path)` was not wrapped, so
  a device with no container package/hardware at all (e.g. a ROS6-only
  box) raised a raw `DeviceCommandError` straight from the device's own
  RouterOS response, instead of degrading the way the read tool
  `containers()` already does (returns `[]`, no error). Now caught and
  raised as `ResourceNotFoundError` - the same clear error already used
  for "no container matches this name/tag" - never the raw device-side
  text.

### Tests

25 new tests (476 → 501, full suite green): generator-vs-list regression
tests for `monitor_traffic`/`poe_monitor`/`lte_monitor` (both against the
fakes' contract directly and against empty/non-empty generator replies);
`guard.set_wifi_ssid`'s new `configuration`-resolution path (preview+apply
writes to the configuration row and never the interface row, unknown
`configuration` name, ambiguous interface with neither shape, read-only
gate), plus an audit-journal test proving a `passphrase` field on that
configuration row never reaches the journal; `audit._SENSITIVE_KEY`
coverage for every new spelling (`passphrase`, `security.passphrase`,
`wpa2-pre-shared-key`, `wpa-pre-shared-key`, `psk`, `pre-shared-key`,
`pre_shared_key`, `preshared`), flat and nested; `start_container`/
`stop_container` against a device with no `/container` menu at all.

## [0.7.0] - Unreleased

LTE/5G + containers + USB round: read tools for cellular WAN status,
RouterOS's container subsystem, and USB hardware, plus one new mechanic on
the write-guard - `start_container`/`stop_container`, the first guarded
writes whose RouterOS operation is an ACTION command (`/container/start`,
`/container/stop`) rather than an update/add/remove `set`. Same write-guard
mechanism as every previous round (read-only default, central allowlist,
confirm/preview, audit journal, ROS6/ROS7 compat) - extended, not weakened
or bypassed. See "How start/stop extends the guard" below.

### Added

- **`lte_status`** (read, `src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py`): signal/status of
  one LTE/5G modem interface, via `/interface/lte/monitor <interface>
  once=yes` - operator (`current-operator`), technology
  (`access-technology`: 3G/LTE/5G), signal (`rsrp`/`rsrq`/`sinr`/`rssi`),
  `band`, `registration-status`, `cell-id`. Reuses the exact same
  "monitor-once" construction as v0.6's `interface_traffic`/`poe_status`
  (`once=""` as a structured flag, one reply, no continuous stream - see
  `MikrotikClient.lte_monitor` below). `interface` is validated for shape
  (`validate_interface_name`, reused from v0.6) before use. Returns an empty
  dict (never an error) for a device with no LTE hardware/package at all,
  same convention as `poe_status`/`system_health` for optional hardware.
- **`lte_interfaces`** (read): lists `/interface/lte` - name, running,
  disabled, apn-profiles, etc. Empty list (not an error) with no LTE
  hardware.
- **`containers`** (read): lists `/container` - name/tag, status,
  ram-usage, root-dir, interface, os. Empty list (not an error) with no
  container package/hardware support.
- **`container_config`** (read): `/container/config` (registry-url,
  tmpdir, ram-high, ...) - a single-row menu. Empty dict (not an error)
  with no container package.
- **`usb_devices`** (read): combines `/system/routerboard/usb` (physical
  USB ports, if the board exposes them) and `/disk` (attached storage - USB
  flash drives, and USB LTE/5G modems that surface as a disk rather than
  under routerboard/usb) into `{"usb_ports": [...], "disks": [...]}`, since
  which of the two a given USB device shows up under depends on the
  hardware. Either or both lists empty (never an error) if the board
  exposes neither.
- **`start_container`/`stop_container`** (WRITE, guarded - new `ALLOWLIST`
  entries `src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py`): start/stop a container by `name` or
  `tag` (`/container/start`/`/container/stop`). Same guard mechanics as
  every other write tool - blocked by the read-only gate unless
  `MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE=true`, `confirm=false` previews a before/after
  without touching the device, only `confirm=true` applies it, raises
  `ResourceNotFoundError` if `container` doesn't match any `/container`
  row's `name` or `tag` (never creates one), and goes through the v0.5
  audit-journal `_audited` decorator automatically - the device password
  never appears in the journal. See "How start/stop extends the guard"
  below for the new mechanics this round adds on top of that.
- `MikrotikClient.lte_monitor` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/client.py`): new read
  primitive, built exactly like `monitor_traffic`/`poe_monitor` - the
  callable connection form, `once=""`, automatic read-retry, transport
  failures wrapped as `DeviceCommandError`.
- `MikrotikClient.start`/`.stop` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/client.py`, new): the
  first *action-command* write primitives, alongside `update`/`add`/
  `remove`. Each sends exactly one fixed command word (`"start"`/`"stop"`)
  via the connection's `path(*segments)(cmd, **{".id": id})` callable form
  (mirroring `librouteros.api.Path.__call__`, the same mechanism its own
  `Path.remove()` uses for `.id`-targeted operations) - never a
  caller-supplied command or path. No retry, same reasoning as
  `update`/`add`/`remove` (idempotency isn't guaranteed for a repeated
  action either).
- `validation.validate_container_identifier` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/validation.py`):
  shape validation for a container `name`/`tag` identifier - non-empty, no
  control characters, length-capped. Deliberately NOT restricted to
  `_INTERFACE_NAME`/`_LIST_NAME`'s conservative charset, since a real
  container `tag` is a Docker-style image reference that legitimately
  contains `:`, `/`, and `.` (e.g.
  `"myregistry.example.com:5000/library/alpine:latest"`).

### How start/stop extends the guard

`start_container`/`stop_container` are the first `ALLOWLIST` entries whose
`action` is neither `"update"`, `"add"`, nor `"remove"` - RouterOS's
`/container/start`/`/container/stop` are ACTION commands (the CLI syntax is
`/container start <numbers>`, not a `set`), so the guard mechanism itself
was extended, carefully, to cover that shape without opening up anything
new:

- **Two new fixed `MikrotikClient` methods, `.start`/`.stop`**, each
  sending exactly one hardcoded RouterOS command word - never a command or
  path supplied by a caller (see `client.py` above). There is still no way
  to reach an arbitrary API path or command through this package; `.start`/
  `.stop` are exactly as narrow as `.update`/`.add`/`.remove` were before
  them.
- **Dispatch still goes through the same `getattr(client, op.action)`
  mechanism** every other guarded write already used (see `set_identity`'s
  A1 dispatch, `guard.py`) - `ALLOWLIST["start_container"].action ==
  "start"` and `ALLOWLIST["stop_container"].action == "stop"` are what
  actually get called, exactly as `"update"`/`"add"`/`"remove"` did for
  every prior write. `guard._set_container_running` (the shared
  implementation behind both) never calls `client.start`/`.stop` directly -
  only via that same `op.action` indirection.
- **The container is always resolved server-side, by `.id`, before the
  action fires** - `guard._find_container_row` looks up the caller-supplied
  `container` string against `/container`'s `name` field first, then `tag`
  (mirroring `set_wifi_ssid`'s ROS7-then-ROS6 fallback shape), and only
  ever passes the resolved row's own `.id` to `client.start`/`.stop`. A
  `container` that doesn't match any row raises `ResourceNotFoundError` -
  `start_container`/`stop_container` never create a container, same "never
  creates the target" invariant as `enable_interface`/`set_poe_out`/etc.
- **Same read-only gate and confirm/preview flow, unchanged.**
  `_require_allowed` (the read-only gate + allowlist check) runs first, exactly
  like every other write, before the device is ever touched by a
  `container` lookup. `confirm=false` computes and returns a before/after
  preview - `after.status` set to the *immediate* transitional status
  RouterOS's action command sets (`"starting"`/`"stopping"`), not a
  guaranteed final state, since starting/stopping a container is
  RouterOS-async (image extraction, process startup) rather than the
  synchronous field-set `enable_interface`/`set_poe_out` make - without
  touching the device; only `confirm=true` calls `client.start`/`.stop`.
- **Same `_audited` decorator, unchanged** - `start_container`/
  `stop_container` are journaled exactly like every other write, with
  `action` in the journal now correctly showing `"start"`/`"stop"` instead
  of being forced into the old three-value enum.

### Tests

61 new tests (415 → 476, full suite green): `MikrotikClient.lte_monitor`
(structured params not a command string, empty-reply handling,
transport-error wrapping, read retry) and `.start`/`.stop` (action-command
dispatch via the structured `.id` parameter, only the targeted row changes,
transport-error wrapping, no retry - extending the existing
"writes never retry" parametrized case);
`validation.validate_container_identifier` (valid/invalid/non-string
cases, including that a Docker-style `registry:port/repo:tag` identifier is
accepted); `guard.start_container`/`.stop_container` (blocked read-only,
gate-before-touch, preview/confirm, name-then-tag resolution, `.id`-targeted
dispatch proven via the same monkeypatched-action technique as
`set_identity`'s A1 test, unknown container, invalid identifier before
touching the device, audit journal outcomes including the extended
no-password-leak sweep across all twelve write tools); and `lte_status`/
`lte_interfaces`/`containers`/`container_config`/`usb_devices`/
`start_container`/`stop_container` exercised end to end through `server.py`'s
`call_tool` (happy paths, the read-only-by-default and
read-tools-never-gated cases, empty/no-hardware fallback for every new read
tool, and the invalid-input/unknown-resource error paths for the two new
write tools).

## [0.6.0] - Unreleased

Physical layer / L2 observability round, plus PoE control: read tools to
locate a device on the physical topology and read its live traffic/PoE
state, and one new guarded write tool to power-cycle a PoE port. Built on
top of the same write-guard mechanism as every previous round (read-only
default, central allowlist, confirm/preview, audit journal, ROS6/ROS7
compat) - none of it weakened or bypassed.

### Added

- **`arp_table`** (read, `src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py`): lists the IPv4 ARP
  table (`/ip/arp`) - address, mac-address, interface, dynamic, complete.
  Cross-references an IP to a MAC (or vice versa) for a statically-addressed
  device that never shows up in `dhcp_leases`.
- **`bridge_hosts`** (read): lists `/interface/bridge/host` entries -
  mac-address, on-interface, bridge, dynamic, local. Finds which physical
  bridge port a MAC is currently learned on.
- **`interface_traffic`** (read): current rx/tx rate of one interface, via
  `/interface/monitor-traffic interface=<X> once=yes`. `once=""` is sent as
  a structured flag parameter (RouterOS API convention for a boolean/flag -
  an empty value, not the string "yes") so the device replies exactly once
  and the call returns promptly, instead of opening the continuous/streaming
  form of monitor-traffic that RouterOS uses when `once` is omitted
  entirely. `interface` is validated for shape
  (`validation.validate_interface_name`, new) before ever being sent.
- **`poe_status`** (read): PoE configuration + live consumption for every
  PoE-capable ethernet port on the device. Reads `/interface/ethernet` and
  keeps only rows with a `poe-out` field, then reads
  `/interface/ethernet/poe/monitor once=yes` per port for
  voltage/current/power/`poe-out-status`. A port whose live monitor call
  fails is still listed (with its configured `poe-out`, just without the
  live fields) rather than failing the whole call. Returns an empty list
  (never an error) for a device with no PoE hardware at all.
- **`set_poe_out`** (WRITE, guarded - new `ALLOWLIST` entry
  `src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py`): sets a PoE-capable ethernet port's
  `poe-out` mode (`/interface/ethernet set [interface] poe-out=<mode>`,
  action `update`). `poe_out` must be one of `auto-on`/`forced-on`/`off`
  (new `validation.validate_poe_out`). Killer use case: remotely
  power-cycling a locked-up antenna/camera/AP powered over PoE - `off` then
  `auto-on` again - instead of a truck roll. Same guard mechanics as every
  other write tool: blocked by the read-only gate unless
  `MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE=true`, `confirm=false` previews a before/after
  without touching the device, only `confirm=true` applies it, and it never
  creates or coerces anything - raises `ResourceNotFoundError` if
  `interface_name` doesn't exist on the device at all, or exists but has no
  `poe-out` field (not PoE-capable hardware, e.g. an SFP+ cage). Goes
  through the v0.5 audit-journal `_audited` decorator automatically, like
  every other guarded write - the device password never appears in the
  journal.
- `MikrotikClient.monitor_traffic`/`.poe_monitor` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/client.py`):
  new read primitives for the two "monitor once" RouterOS commands above,
  built the same way as `ping`/`traceroute` - the callable connection form
  (`connection(cmd, **kwargs)`), automatic read-retry on a transient network
  error (`_run_read`), and transport failures wrapped as
  `DeviceCommandError`. No new timeout logic was needed: `once=""` is
  RouterOS's own "reply once and stop" contract (mirrored from its CLI
  `once=yes` flag), and the connection's existing socket timeout
  (`MikrotikClient`'s `timeout`/`MIKROTIK_TIMEOUT`) already bounds every
  command sent over it, exactly as it already did for `ping`/`traceroute`.
- `validation.validate_interface_name`/`validate_poe_out`
  (`src/mcp_mikrotik/validation.py`): shape validation for a RouterOS
  interface name and the `poe-out` enum, used by `interface_traffic` and
  `set_poe_out`.

### Tests

61 new tests (352 → 415, full suite green): `validate_interface_name`/
`validate_poe_out` (valid/invalid/non-string cases);
`MikrotikClient.monitor_traffic`/`.poe_monitor` (structured params not a
command string, empty-reply handling, transport-error wrapping, read
retry); `guard.set_poe_out` (blocked read-only, gate-before-touch,
preview/confirm, `.id`-targeted dispatch, unknown interface, non-PoE
interface, invalid `poe_out`/`interface_name` before touching the device,
audit journal outcomes including the no-password-leak sweep); and
`arp_table`/`bridge_hosts`/`interface_traffic`/`poe_status`/`set_poe_out`
exercised end to end through `server.py`'s `call_tool` (happy paths, the
read-only-by-default and read-tools-never-gated cases, empty-PoE-device
case, one-bad-port resilience for `poe_status`, and the invalid-input and
unknown-resource error paths for `set_poe_out`).

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased

Production-hardening round: layers added *around* the existing write-guard
mechanism (read-only default, central allowlist, confirm/preview, ROS6/ROS7
compat) - none of it weakens or bypasses that mechanism. See README's new
"Production features: audit log, correlation IDs, retries, circuit breaker"
section for the full writeup.

### Added

- **Audit journal** (`src/mcp_mikrotik/audit.py`, new module): every guarded
  write call in `guard.py` now emits exactly one structured JSON-lines
  event via a new `_audited` decorator applied to all nine write functions -
  `timestamp`, `correlation_id`, `device_name`, `tool`, `operation`
  (the `ALLOWLIST` key), `action`, `confirm`, `outcome`
  (`preview`/`applied`/`error`), and a `summary` of the before/after change
  (or the error). Emitted for a preview (`confirm=false`), an apply
  (`confirm=true`), and any error - including a write blocked by the
  read-only gate before the device is ever touched. Recursively strips any
  dict key that looks sensitive (`password`/`secret`/`token`/`credential`,
  case-insensitive) from the summary before it is ever serialized - the
  device password never appears in the journal. Destination is
  `MIKROTIK_AUDIT_LOG` (append-only file) if set, otherwise a plain
  `INFO`-level line via `logging` (stderr). Always best-effort: a failure
  writing the journal is logged as a warning and never blocks or fails the
  write operation it describes.
- **Correlation IDs** (`src/mcp_mikrotik/correlation.py`, new module): every
  MCP tool call (read or write) is bound a short, unique id
  (`uuid4().hex[:12]`) for its duration, via a `contextvars.ContextVar` set
  once per call in `server.py`'s `_safe` wrapper. Appears in every audit
  journal entry a write produces, and is prefixed onto the server-side log
  line if a tool call fails (`[<id>] tool <name> failed: ...` /
  `[<id>] Unhandled error in tool <name>`) - never appended to the
  exception's own message, so no caller-facing error text changes shape.
- **Read retry** (`src/mcp_mikrotik/client.py`): `MikrotikClient.path`/
  `ping`/`traceroute` now retry automatically on a transient network error -
  a fresh connect attempt failing, or an in-flight command failing because
  of an underlying `OSError` - with a short backoff (0.5s, then 1s; further
  retries reuse 1s). Up to `MIKROTIK_READ_RETRIES` extra attempts (default
  2). A `LibRouterosError` (RouterOS itself rejected the command) is never
  retried. `update`/`add`/`remove` (the write primitives) are deliberately
  untouched - no retry, ever, since a retried write isn't guaranteed
  idempotent.
- **Circuit breaker** (`src/mcp_mikrotik/client.py`, `CircuitBreaker` class):
  each pooled `MikrotikClient` now owns a thread-safe, in-memory breaker for
  its device's connection attempts. After `MIKROTIK_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`
  consecutive connection failures (default 3), the circuit opens for
  `MIKROTIK_BREAKER_COOLDOWN` seconds (default 30): further calls to that
  device - read or write - raise `CircuitOpenError` immediately (`circuit
  open for '<device>', retry after <t>s`), without attempting a connection.
  A successful connection resets the failure count and closes the circuit.
  Scoped strictly to the connection step - `guard.py`'s read-only
  gate/allowlist check always runs first, entirely before `MikrotikClient`
  is touched, so the breaker can never be used to skip it.
- `CircuitOpenError` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/exceptions.py`): a
  `DeviceConnectionError` subclass raised by the circuit breaker, so
  existing `except DeviceConnectionError` handling keeps working unchanged.
- Env vars: `MIKROTIK_AUDIT_LOG` (unset = log to stderr), `MIKROTIK_READ_RETRIES`
  (default `2`), `MIKROTIK_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` (default `3`),
  `MIKROTIK_BREAKER_COOLDOWN` (default `30`) - see `.env.example` and
  README's configuration table.

### Notes

- Purely additive: the write-guard mechanism itself (read-only default,
  central allowlist, confirm/preview, "never creates the target"/"never
  silently duplicates") is unchanged - see "Security model" in README.
  `guard.py`'s `_audited` decorator wraps every existing write function
  without altering its own logic.

## [0.4.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Read tools: `address_lists` (`/ip/firewall/address-list` - list, address,
  timeout, dynamic, disabled), `firewall_nat` (`/ip/firewall/nat`),
  `scheduler` (`/system/scheduler`), `ip_pools` (`/ip/pool`).
- `traceroute`: diagnostic tool (`/tool/traceroute`), returning the list of
  hops. `address` is validated exactly like `ping`'s; `count` and `max_hops`
  are capped low (`MAX_TRACEROUTE_COUNT`/`MAX_TRACEROUTE_MAX_HOPS` in
  `src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py`), and a fixed short per-hop timeout is always
  sent to the device (`src/mcp_mikrotik/client.py`), so the command can't
  run long enough to hit RouterOS's own ~60s API command timeout. Not a
  write - not gated by `MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE`.
- Guarded write tool `add_to_address_list`: adds an IP/subnet to a named
  firewall address-list. Refuses to create a duplicate `list_name`+`address`
  pair - raises `ResourceAlreadyExistsError` instead. Optional `comment`/
  `timeout` fields. **Only manages the list** - it does not create or modify
  any firewall rule; see README's new "Blocking/allowing a client via
  address lists" section for why a filter rule referencing the list is
  still required for this to actually block/allow anything.
- Guarded write tool `remove_from_address_list`: removes a `list_name`+
  `address` entry from a firewall address-list. Raises `ResourceNotFoundError`
  if no such entry exists.
- Validation (`src/mcp_mikrotik/validation.py`): `validate_address_list_name`
  (firewall address-list `list` name), `validate_comment` (free-text
  `comment`, rejects control characters/newlines), `validate_timeout`
  (RouterOS `w/d/h/m/s` duration or `HH:MM:SS` clock value).

### Fixed

- `remove_simple_queue` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py`): `target` is now
  validated *before* the device is read (`client.path(...)`), matching
  every other write tool's validate-before-touch order. Previously an
  invalid `target` still triggered a device read before the validation
  error was raised.

### Notes

- **Address-list is not a firewall rule.** `add_to_address_list`/
  `remove_from_address_list` manage list membership only; blocking/allowing
  traffic requires a separate `/ip/firewall/filter` (or NAT) rule that
  references the list name (e.g. `src-address-list=list_name action=drop`).
  See README's "Blocking/allowing a client via address lists" section.

## [0.3.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Read tool: `simple_queues` (`/queue/simple`) - name, target, max-limit,
  limit-at, bytes counters, disabled. Lets an operator see who already has a
  bandwidth limit and how much traffic they've moved before deciding who to
  limit next.
- Guarded write tool `set_client_bandwidth`: limits a client's bandwidth via
  a RouterOS Simple Queue targeting an IP/subnet. Updates the existing queue
  if one already targets `target`, otherwise creates one with a name
  deterministically derived from `target` - backed by two allowlist entries
  (`set_client_bandwidth_update`/`set_client_bandwidth_add`), following the
  same "two fixed, reviewed paths, chosen by the guard function, never by
  the caller" shape as `set_wifi_ssid`. `max_limit`/`limit_at` are validated
  as RouterOS rate pairs (`validate_rate_pair`, `src/mcp_mikrotik/validation.py`).
- Guarded write tool `add_static_dhcp_lease`: creates a static DHCP lease
  (`/ip/dhcp-server/lease`) pinning an IP address to a MAC address (useful
  to give a client a stable target before limiting it). Refuses to create a
  second lease for a MAC that already has one - raises the new
  `ResourceAlreadyExistsError` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/exceptions.py`) instead of
  duplicating.
- Guarded write tool `remove_simple_queue`: removes a Simple Queue by
  `target` or `name`, to undo a bandwidth limit.
- Validation: `validate_target` (IPv4/IPv6 address or `/prefix` subnet, for
  Simple Queue `target`), `validate_ip_address` (plain address, for DHCP
  lease `address` - unlike `validate_ping_address`, no hostname), `validate_mac_address`,
  `validate_rate_pair` (RouterOS `upload/download` rate pairs, e.g. `"10M/5M"`)
  - all in `src/mcp_mikrotik/validation.py`.

### Notes

- **FastTrack gotcha**: if a device has a FastTrack rule in its firewall (a
  common default from RouterOS's own quick-set wizards), fasttracked
  connections bypass Simple Queue entirely - `set_client_bandwidth` may have
  no visible effect on a client whose traffic is already fasttracked. This
  is documented in `set_client_bandwidth`'s docstring (`server.py`/`guard.py`)
  and in README's "Security model" section below.

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Read tools: `dhcp_leases`, `wireless_registrations` (ROS7 wifi
  registration table with automatic ROS6 wireless fallback; returns an
  empty list rather than erroring on a device with no radio), `dns_cache`,
  `firewall_filter`, `system_health` (empty list on devices/boards without
  health sensors).
- Guarded write tools: `enable_interface` and `disable_interface` (set
  `/interface disabled=no|yes` by name), and `set_wifi_ssid` (detects the
  ROS7 `/interface/wifi` vs ROS6 `/interface/wireless` path per device and
  writes to whichever matches). All three go through the exact same
  read-only gate + central allowlist + confirm/preview mechanism as
  `set_identity` - see `src/mcp_mikrotik/guard.py`.
- `ResourceNotFoundError` (`src/mcp_mikrotik/exceptions.py`): raised by the
  new write tools when the named interface/wireless network doesn't exist on
  the device, so a typo in the name can never silently create one.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: runs `pytest` on push/PR against Python 3.11
  and 3.12.

### Changed

- README: tools table split further to list every new read/write tool,
  "Security model" section documents the `set_wifi_ssid` two-path allowlist
  exception and the "never creates the target" behavior of the new write
  tools, "Roadmap / non-goals" explains why reboot and firewall writes are
  still intentionally excluded.

## [0.1.0] - Initial public release

### Added

- Read tools: `list_devices`, `system_info`, `interfaces`, `ip_addresses`,
  `ip_routes`, `neighbors`, `logs`, `ping`, `list_write_operations`.
- One guarded write tool, `set_identity`, exercising the full write-guard
  mechanism end to end: read-only gate (`MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE`), a central
  named allowlist (`guard.ALLOWLIST`) with no generic command tool, and
  explicit `confirm` with a before/after preview.
- Structured RouterOS API access via `librouteros` (no shell/string-built
  commands - command injection ruled out by construction), ROS6/ROS7
  compatibility, per-device TLS verification for `api-ssl`, connection
  pooling, and a full pytest suite against an in-memory fake device.
