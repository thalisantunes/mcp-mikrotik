"""Central write-guard: allowlist of write operations + read-only gate + confirm mechanics.

This module is the ONLY place in mcp-mikrotik allowed to call
MikrotikClient.update()/add()/remove(). server.py never calls those methods
directly - a write tool in server.py always calls a dedicated function here
(e.g. set_identity below), so there is no code path through which an LLM (or
any tool caller) can reach an arbitrary API path. Every writable operation is
represented by exactly one WriteOperation entry in ALLOWLIST, naming the
single path+action it is allowed to touch.

Two independent controls apply to every write:
  1. Read-only gate: MIKROTIK_ALLOW_WRITE must be true (Settings.allow_write),
     checked before anything is read or written, regardless of `confirm`.
  2. Confirm/preview: with confirm=False, the operation computes and returns
     a before/after preview without calling the device's write primitive at
     all. Only confirm=True applies the change.

To add a new write tool in a future iteration:
  1. Add a WriteOperation entry to ALLOWLIST below (path tuple + action).
  2. Add a function here (following the shape of set_identity) that builds
     the before/after preview and, when confirm=True, applies it via the
     matching MikrotikClient primitive.
  3. Register a corresponding @mcp.tool() in server.py that calls it and
     passes `confirm` straight through.
Never add a generic "run this path with this action" entry or function -
each write operation must stay individually named and reviewable.

    #   * firewall filter/NAT/mangle rule CREATION or general modification
    #     ("ip/firewall/filter|nat|mangle" add, or update of any field other
    #     than `disabled`): a single wrong rule (e.g. one that blocks the API
    #     port, or disables the masquerade rule providing a LAN's Internet
    #     access) can lock out management access or connectivity with no
    #     remote recovery. v0.11 (filter) and v1.4 (NAT/mangle) deliberately
    #     only expose toggling `disabled` on a rule an admin already created
    #     and reviewed themselves (see enable_firewall_rule/
    #     disable_firewall_rule, enable_nat_rule/disable_nat_rule, and
    #     enable_mangle_rule/disable_mangle_rule above) - authoring or
    #     otherwise editing a rule still needs staged/rollback support (e.g.
    #     RouterOS safe mode) before it belongs in this allowlist.
    #   * backup RESTORE ("system/backup/load"): same class of risk as
    #     reboot - loading a backup overwrites the device's ENTIRE running
    #     configuration and reboots it, with no meaningful before/after
    #     preview and no rollback if the wrong file (or the right file, at
    #     the wrong time) is loaded. v0.14 only ever exposes CREATING a
    #     backup (create_backup) and listing existing ones (list_backups) -
    #     restoring one stays a manual, on-device (WinBox/CLI) operation
    #     until it has its own confirmation/cooldown policy, same as reboot.
    # --- Next iteration adds entries here, each with its own WriteOperation
    # + dedicated function. See module docstring above for the steps.

#
# Three routing tools (set_route_distance/enable_route/disable_route) plus
# two Netwatch tools (add_netwatch/remove_netwatch) - each a small, atomic
# step an LLM caller composes to build or adjust a failover setup, not one
# black-box "do a failover" command. See README's "Failover control" for the
# recommended step-by-step flow (netwatch observes a gateway; distance/
# enable/disable actually switches traffic to a different route).
#
# All three route writes share _resolve_route below: a route is identified
# by the STABLE (dst-address, gateway) pair (optionally narrowed further by
# `comment`) - never by a dynamic `.id` or a list index, both of which can
# silently shift as routes are added/removed elsewhere on the device between
# a preview (confirm=False) and the confirmed apply (confirm=True). This
# matters more here than for any other write tool in this package: routes
# govern where traffic actually goes, so resolving the wrong row - or
# guessing among several equally-matching ones - is the one mistake this
# round cannot afford to make silently.

# the ADMIN controls, never a dynamic `.id`/list index that can silently
# shift as rules are added/removed elsewhere on the device between a preview
# and a confirmed apply.
#
# The workflow this is built for (the community-suggested design this round
# follows, given the lockout risk a wrong firewall write carries - see
# README's "Roadmap / non-goals"): an admin creates a rule ahead of time on
# the device itself, e.g.
#
#   /ip firewall filter add chain=forward src-address-list=attacker-x \

# enable_firewall_rule(comment="Bloqueio_Ataque_X") when it detects the
# condition the rule exists to guard against - never by asking this package
# to author a new rule itself. If something goes wrong, the admin knows
# EXACTLY which rule was toggled: the same one they already wrote and
# reviewed, never one this package created on its own judgment.
#
# Resolution never falls back to "just pick one": a `comment` that matches

    - see this section's module comment above for the full design rationale.

    v1.4: also the shared implementation behind enable_nat_rule/
    disable_nat_rule and enable_mangle_rule/disable_mangle_rule (see the
    "v1.4: NAT & mangle rule toggle" section further below) - the resolution
    and toggle logic below never referenced anything filter-specific (it
    already only ever touches `op.path`, whatever ALLOWLIST entry
    `operation_name` names), so the SAME function is reused rather than
    duplicated per menu. `resource_label` is the only thing that varies
    between the three - it's what ResourceNotFoundError/AmbiguousResourceError
    call the resolved thing in their error message (e.g. "Firewall filter
    rule" vs "Firewall NAT rule" vs "Firewall mangle rule"), so an error for
    one menu is never confused for another. The filter pair's own behavior is
    UNCHANGED: `resource_label` defaults to "Firewall filter rule", exactly
    what this function always raised before v1.4.

    Resolves EXACTLY one row (in the ALLOWLIST entry's `op.path` menu -
    /ip/firewall/filter, /ip/firewall/nat, or /ip/firewall/mangle) by
    `comment` (optionally narrowed by `chain`). Raises ResourceNotFoundError
    if nothing matches - NEVER creates a rule as a fallback. Raises
    AmbiguousResourceError if more than one row still matches after
    narrowing.

    The returned WritePreview's `before`/`after` are full copies of the
    matched row (every field RouterOS returned for it, not just `disabled`)
    - deliberately, so a caller reading the preview can confirm WHICH rule
    (its `chain`/`action`/every other field) it is about to toggle before
    ever passing `confirm=true`, not just see the one field being written.
    That is exactly the "the operator knows which rule this is" safeguard
    this family of tools exists to provide.

# and this round's new `firewall_mangle`): same "admin creates the rule ahead
# of time, disabled, on the device; an LLM caller only ever flips its
# `disabled` field later, resolved by the STABLE `comment` it was given" -
# same lockout reasoning (a wrong NAT/mangle write can be just as disruptive
# as a wrong filter rule - e.g. disabling the masquerade rule that provides a
# whole LAN's Internet access), same never-guesses-which-row resolution
# (ResourceNotFoundError / AmbiguousResourceError), same never-creates
# guarantee. See ROADMAP.md's "Explicitly NOT on the roadmap" table entry -
# rule creation/free-form edit stays out of scope for filter, NAT, AND mangle
# alike, for the identical reason.
#
# `chain` narrows an ambiguous `comment` match exactly like the filter pair -
# NAT's real chains are `srcnat`/`dstnat`, mangle's are `prerouting`/
# `postrouting`/`forward`/`input`/`output` (plus custom jump-target chains on
# either menu), but `validate_firewall_chain` is shape-only, not a fixed
# enum, for the same reason it already isn't for filter: RouterOS allows
# arbitrary custom chains there too.
#
# All four functions below are thin wrappers around the SAME
# `_set_firewall_rule_disabled` helper the filter pair uses (see that
# function's docstring above for why one shared implementation was kept
# instead of copy-pasting it three times) - only `operation_name` (which
# ALLOWLIST entry, and therefore which `op.path` menu) and `resource_label`

# --- v0.13: WireGuard VPN management -----------------------------------
#
# The most security-sensitive round in this package's history: WireGuard
# uses PRIVATE KEYS. Absolute rule, enforced here (not just in server.py):
# no WritePreview this section returns may EVER carry a `private-key` or
# `preshared-key` field.
#
# WHY the redaction happens HERE, inside guard.py, and not one layer up in
# server.py: the `_audited` decorator wraps every function below and calls
# audit.record() with exactly `result.before`/`result.after` - whatever the
# wrapped function returns, BEFORE server.py (the tool wrapper) ever sees it.
# If a private-key were only stripped in server.py, it would already be
# sitting in the audit journal (a file on disk, or a log line) by the time
# server.py got a chance to redact it. So every function below builds its
# `before`/`after` through `_redact_wireguard_row` (which applies
# `formatting.strip_sensitive_fields` with `formatting.WIREGUARD_SENSITIVE_FIELDS`
# - `{"private-key", "preshared-key"}`) BEFORE constructing the WritePreview
# that `_audited` will log. `audit._SENSITIVE_KEY` (extended this round to
# also match `private`) is a SECOND, independent line of defense on top of
# that - not a substitute for it.
#
# add_wireguard_interface never accepts a private-key parameter at all (there
# is no code path through which a caller could ever supply one - RouterOS
# generates it internally on creation, exactly the same "genuinely absent
# parameter" pattern v0.9's add_netwatch used for up-script/down-script -
# see test_add_wireguard_interface_never_accepts_a_private_key_parameter).
# add_wireguard_peer never accepts a private-key OR preshared-key parameter
# either - the remote peer's own private key, and any preshared key, are
# both entirely out of this tool's scope.

# --- v0.14: hotspot vouchers + backup ---------------------------------------
#
# The last feature round before 1.0. Two independent tools, neither touching
# any menu a previous round already guards:
#   - add_hotspot_user creates a `/ip/hotspot/user` row - a VISITOR login
#     voucher, not a device/API credential. Its password is deliberately
#     handled the OPPOSITE way v0.13's WireGuard private-key is: WireGuard's
#     private-key must never reach the CALLER (RouterOS-internal only,
#     stripped from every return value); a voucher's password is the whole
#     POINT of the tool - the caller needs it to hand to a visitor - so it
#     DOES appear in this function's returned WritePreview.after (and, one
#     layer up, in server.py's `qr_payload`). It must still never reach the
#     audit journal, though - see add_hotspot_user's own docstring below for
#     exactly how that asymmetry is enforced (spoiler: no new code was
#     needed - audit._SENSITIVE_KEY already matches "password", and it
#     applies to ANY dict key at ANY depth in the summary `_audited` logs,
#     not just a device's own connection password).
#   - create_backup is a third ACTION-command entry (after start/stop, v0.7,
#     and flush/wol, v0.10) - "save" is RouterOS's own literal command word
#     for /system/backup/save. Its optional `password` (encrypts the backup
#     FILE - unrelated to a device/API credential) is redacted BEFORE the
#     WritePreview is constructed, the same "redact before constructing the
#     preview" rule v0.13 established for WireGuard's private/preshared
#     keys - see _redact_wireguard_row's usage above - so it can never reach
#     the journal even as a first line of defense, on top of
#     audit._SENSITIVE_KEY's second one.

    `validate_timeout`), and `limit_bytes_total` (a positive integer byte
    quota - `validate_byte_count`) are all optional.

    PASSWORD ASYMMETRY (read this before touching this function): the
    plaintext `password` is the whole point of a voucher - the visitor needs
    it - so it DOES appear in this function's returned `WritePreview.after`
    (both on `confirm=false` preview and `confirm=true` applied - see
    server.py's `add_hotspot_user` tool, which builds `qr_payload` straight
    from it). This is the OPPOSITE of v0.13's WireGuard private-key handling
    (never returned to any caller at all) - deliberately, because a voucher
    password's only purpose is to be handed to someone.

    It must still NEVER reach the audit journal. `_audited` (this function's
    decorator) journals exactly whatever this function returns - so if
    `password` merely stayed out of the RETURN value, it would already be
    safe from the journal too; the fact that it's deliberately IN the return
    value makes this the one write tool in this package where "safe in the
    result" and "safe in the journal" pull in opposite directions. The
    journal side is still covered: `audit._SENSITIVE_KEY` matches "password"
    case-insensitively and `audit._sanitize` drops any dict key matching it
    at ANY depth of the `{"before": ..., "after": ...}` summary `_audited`
    logs - so the exact same `after` dict returned here gets its `password`
    key silently dropped before it ever reaches `audit.record()`'s caller.
    No new redaction code was needed for this - it falls out of the existing
    device-password protection `_SENSITIVE_KEY` already provided. See
    `tests/test_guard_audit.py`'s
    `test_add_hotspot_user_password_never_in_audit_journal` for the proof.

    Refuses to create a duplicate `name` - raises ResourceAlreadyExistsError
    instead of creating a second voucher (or silently resetting the first
    one's password). This tool only ever adds; it never updates or removes
    an existing hotspot user.

    """Set the NTP server(s) a device syncs its clock against
    (`/system/ntp/client`). See `server.py`'s `ntp_client` read tool for the
    field shapes this reads back afterward.

    `servers` must have at least one entry; each is validated as an IPv4/
    IPv6 address OR hostname (`validate_ping_address`, same shape `ping`/
    `add_wireguard_peer`'s `endpoint_address` already accept) BEFORE
    anything is read from the device - fail fast on a caller mistake rather
    than partway through resolving which RouterOS generation is in play.

    GENERATION DETECTION: `/system/ntp/client` is the SAME RouterOS path on
    both generations (unlike `set_wifi_ssid`'s genuinely different
    `/interface/wifi` vs `/interface/wireless` menus) - only the FIELD SHAPE
    differs. This reads the row once and checks which field is present -
    `servers` (ROS7's single comma-joined list) or `primary-ntp` (ROS6's
    fixed two-slot form) - mirroring `set_wifi_ssid`'s own "read first, then
    decide" detection. A device with neither field yet (e.g. a completely
    default/never-configured NTP client) is treated as ROS7 - the newer,
    more common shape - since there is nothing on the row to detect ROS6
    from.

    ROS7: writes the full comma-joined `servers` list, e.g. "1.2.3.4,pool.
    ntp.org" - the raw device string is never split into a list on the read
    side either (see `ntp_client`'s docstring), so this stays symmetric.

    ROS6: has no `servers` list at all - only two fixed slots. `servers[0]`
    maps to `primary-ntp`, `servers[1]` (if given) to `secondary-ntp`; any
    entries beyond the first two are DROPPED, never silently - `warning`
    names exactly which ones were ignored. Older ROS6 firmware only accepts
    a literal IP in either slot (`validation.is_literal_ip_address`); a
    hostname destined for one of those two slots is instead folded into
    `server-dns-names` (RouterOS's own DNS-name field for this menu) IF the
    device's row shows that field exists - never guessed at otherwise. If it
    doesn't exist, that hostname is NOT applied at all (never sent as a
    value RouterOS would likely reject) and `warning` says so. If nothing at
    all ends up applicable (every given server is a hostname the device has
    no way to accept), this raises `ValidationError` rather than silently
    performing a no-op write.

    Never enables/disables the NTP client itself - only the server
    field(s) change. If the client's `enabled` field (`formatting.

# --- v1.11: the dead-man primitive ------------------------------------------
#
# THE differentiator this release adds (see README's "Dead-man / lockout-
# proof writes" section): a reusable, generic anti-lockout mechanism for ANY
# risky remote write, not just wireless. Validated today against the
# highest-risk case in this project's own fleet - an 8.8km PtP link that is
# the SOLE management path to the far-end device. Pattern: before a risky
# write, arm a scheduler LOCAL to the target device that reverts the change
# and self-removes after N minutes. If the write breaks reachability, the
# device heals itself with zero further action from the operator - the
# on-event script runs entirely on-device, independent of whether the API
# session (or anything else) can still reach it afterward. If the write is
# good, cancel_dead_man removes the scheduler before it ever fires.
#
# Deliberately two flat primitives (arm/cancel), not a single "do a risky
# write" black box: arm_dead_man/cancel_dead_man each go through the exact
# same allowlist+confirm+audit machinery as every other guarded write here,
# are individually callable (standalone MCP tools - see server.py), and are
# composed into set_wireless_channel/set_wireless_tx_power below (this
# round's two LOCKOUT-RISK wireless writes) via the private
# _arm_wireless_revert helper - never a new generic "run this write with a
# dead-man" entry point that would weaken the module's core invariant (no
# generic command path, see module docstring).

_DEAD_MAN_NAME_PREFIX = "deadman-"

# Explicit /system/scheduler `policy` for every dead-man this package arms -
# finding 6 of the 2026-07 hardening review. RouterOS's own default policy
# on a freshly-added scheduler entry happens to be permissive enough to run
# this on-event (verified live), but relying on a device-side DEFAULT for
# the one scheduler entry whose entire job is to self-heal a lockout is
# fragile: a device with a hardened/non-default scheduler policy could
# silently arm a dead-man that can never actually run its revert. Setting
# `policy=` explicitly removes that dependency. `reboot` is included even
# though no dead-man revert command reboots anything today (arm_dead_man's
# own denylist - see validate_revert_command - forbids that) because
# RouterOS requires the `reboot` policy bit for some `/system` sub-menu
# writes unrelated to an actual reboot; `policy`/`test` are required to
# manage `/system/scheduler` itself (the on-event's own self-remove
# statement); `read`/`write` cover the actual revert commands.

    2026-07-13 hardware finding that forced this design (verified live
    against ROS 7.21.5, re-verified filtering the device's own log
    `topics`): an `interval`-only `/system scheduler add` (no `start-date`/
    `start-time`) does NOT fire immediately on arm - an earlier read of this
    finding mistook the API's own audit-log entry for the scheduler being
    CREATED (`topics=system,info`, which echoes the new on-event's text) for
    an actual on-event RUN; the real fire event (`topics=script,warning`,
    the `:log warning` this package's own on-event always emits first) only
    happened at creation+interval, exactly once, as expected. The REAL
    problem `interval`-only has is non-repetition, not immediacy: if the
    on-event ever aborts partway through (see `_build_dead_man_script`'s
    module note / the 2026-07 hardening review's finding 2 - RouterOS
    aborts an on-event script entirely at its first unparseable statement,
    so a broken revert command means the trailing self-remove never runs
    either), an `interval`-only schedule is still ARMED and RECURRING - it
    fires the same broken on-event again every `interval` thereafter,
    indefinitely, until someone removes it by hand. A ONE-SHOT schedule
    (`interval="00:00:00"`, RouterOS's own "run once, don't repeat" shape)
    with an EXPLICIT, already-in-the-future `start-date`/`start-time` fires
    exactly once no matter what happens inside the on-event - a broken
    revert fails once and stays failed-but-inert, never retried
    automatically. This combines with `validate_revert_command`'s hardening
    (finding 2) as defense in depth: the one-shot shape bounds the damage
    of a revert command that gets past validation but still breaks at
    RouterOS's own script-parse stage.

    Reads the DEVICE's own clock (`/system/clock`), never this host's: the
    two can disagree (drift, time zone), and it is the device's own clock
    the scheduler evaluates `start-date`/`start-time` against. Also
    midnight/month/year-rollover safe - real `datetime` + `timedelta`
    arithmetic (`formatting.parse_ros_datetime`/`format_ros_date_time`)
    handles every rollover correctly, with an explicit `start-date` removing
    any ambiguity about which day a `start-time`-only schedule would apply
    to.

    Raises `DeviceCommandError` if `/system/clock` can't be read, returns no

    section for the story behind it.

    `revert_commands` (validated by `validate_revert_commands`/
    `validate_revert_command`) is any non-empty list of RouterOS script
    statements that restore a known-good prior state ALREADY READ from the
    device - NOT wireless-specific: a route, a bridge port, a firewall
    rule, anything. This round's two callers (`set_wireless_channel`/
    `set_wireless_tx_power`, via the private `_arm_wireless_revert` helper)
    build theirs from the interface's own BEFORE row, already read and
    already validated from the device - never from raw, uninspected caller
    text. A future risky write in another domain can call this primitive
    directly with its own revert commands. `revert_commands` is deliberately
    NOT a generic command-execution channel: `validate_revert_command`
    rejects a fixed denylist of dangerous verbs (`/system reboot`,
    `/system backup load`, `/user`, `/system reset-configuration`,
    `/system routerboard`) - this primitive restores state, it does not run
    arbitrary RouterOS commands.

    `name` is generated HERE - always "deadman-<10 lower-case hex chars>",
    NEVER caller-supplied - and returned in the applied preview's
    `after["name"]` (and set_wireless_channel/set_wireless_tx_power's own
    `WritePreview.dead_man["name"]` when armed internally) as the handle
    `cancel_dead_man` needs afterward.

    The scheduler this arms fires exactly ONCE, `minutes` (1-60) after being
    armed - computed as an explicit future `start-date`/`start-time` from
    the TARGET DEVICE's own `/system/clock` (`_dead_man_deadline`), with
    `interval="00:00:00"` (RouterOS's own "don't repeat" shape). See
    `_dead_man_deadline`'s docstring for why this is a one-shot,
    explicit-future-deadline schedule and not an `interval`-only recurring
    one: the risk an `interval`-only schedule doesn't cover is a revert
    command that breaks partway through (RouterOS aborts an on-event at its
    first unparseable statement, so the trailing self-remove never runs
    either) - `interval`-only would then keep RE-FIRING the same broken
    on-event every `interval`, indefinitely; one-shot fires exactly once no
    matter what happens inside it.

    Like every guarded write, `confirm=False` returns a preview of the exact
    scheduler (name/start-date/start-time/on-event) that would be armed,
    without touching the device; only `confirm=True` actually arms it. Both
    branches read the device's `/system/clock` first (to compute the real
    deadline the preview reports) - this is the one read `arm_dead_man`
    performs even on a `confirm=False` preview.

    channel-width). LOCKOUT-RISK: on a PtP link that is itself the
    management path to the far-end device, a bad frequency can cut the only
    route back to it.

    By default (`arm_deadman=True`, the safe default), a `confirm=True`
    apply FIRST arms a dead-man (`arm_dead_man`) whose revert command
    restores this interface's CURRENT frequency/channel-width (read here,
    before anything changes) - see README's "Dead-man..." section. Pass
    `arm_deadman=False` only when this specific interface is known NOT to be
    a management path (e.g. a lab AP) and the extra scheduler isn't wanted.
    `deadman_minutes` (1-60, default 3 - the exact window verified live
    today) controls how long the device waits before self-healing; ignored
    when `arm_deadman=False`.

    The returned preview's `warning` ALWAYS reports whether the target
    `frequency` needs a DFS Channel Availability Check under this
    interface's CURRENT `frequency-mode` (read from the device, never
    assumed) - see `_dfs_preview_warning`. When a dead-man is armed, the
    returned `dead_man` field carries `{"name", "minutes"}`: pass `name` to
    `cancel_dead_man` once the new channel is confirmed good, or the device
    reverts on its own.

    When arming, refuses (`ValidationError`) if `deadman_minutes` is
    SHORTER than the CAC the target `frequency` itself requires (e.g. the
    default 3min against the weather-radar sub-band's ~10min CAC) - a
    window that short could revert the change while the interface is still
    mid-CAC, before you could ever confirm the link is back up; raise
    `deadman_minutes` or pass `arm_deadman=False` if you accept the risk.
    Also refuses (before writing anything) if `channel_width` was given but
    this interface's current state has no `channel-width` to revert TO -
    arming would otherwise produce a PARTIAL revert (frequency restored,
    channel-width silently left on the new value).

    Errors if `interface_name` doesn't exist on `/interface/wireless` -
    never creates one. See the module note above this tool's ALLOWLIST
    entry for why this targets `/interface/wireless` only (not ROS7's newer

    and CCQ from 34 to 94. There is no single "right" power for every link -
    it depends on distance/antenna gain/regulatory limits - this tool
